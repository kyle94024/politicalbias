"For anyone with sincere and absolute convictions on abortion, pro-life or pro-choice, Donald Trump’s attempts to reposition himself this week should be somewhere between depressing and infuriating.

For pro-lifers, the problem is the cynicism — the reminder that Trump is purely transactional in his relationship to their ideals, a lousy spokesman for the cause of unborn human life and a willing betrayer when politics requires it.

For pro-choicers, the problem is the chutzpah — the man who did so much to overturn Roe v. Wade trying to disavow responsibility for its policy consequences.

But Trump’s cynicism is also one of his political strengths. What he does crudely, with naked calculation and comic transparency, is what successful politicians used to do more normally: triangulate between your base and the general public, make showy moves to reassure swing voters that you’re not just an ideologue, suggest that you’re willing to negotiate when public opinion is against you.

Trump often does this with symbolism rather than substance, with dishonest framings of his own record and promised policy innovations that don’t actually materialize. But still, he does it all the time, not just on social issues like abortion. The public doesn’t like his opposition to Obamacare? Next thing you know he’s promising to mend the program rather than ending it. Middle-of-the-road voters seem uneasy about Israel’s war in Gaza? There’s Trump, Mr. Israel in his first term, suddenly sounding notes of caution and concern.

What’s non-negotiable with Trump are his personal grievances, his amour-propre, his election-fraud narratives, his authoritarian style. That kind of intransigence is his major political weakness (in addition to being a source of danger for the country). But on policy, he’s always ready to perform flexibly, even if there isn’t a clear plan underneath the posturing.

This has long made a contrast with more doctrinaire Republican politicians, which is part of why Trump beat them in 2016 and again in 2024. But it also makes a contrast with Joe Biden. Not with the Biden of the past, who built a long and successful career as a moderate Democrat who could be relied upon to annoy people to his left. But with the Biden of the current moment, who still benefits from that moderate brand, but struggles to demonstrate policy independence from his party’s activists.

In part, Biden is unlucky in the challenges confronting him: The place where he is clearly trying to triangulate, the Israel-Gaza war, divides his own coalition in a way that makes every possible balancing act anger more people than it pleases.

But his administration has also consistently missed more plausible opportunities for outreach. You see this on issues like abortion and youth gender transitions: Biden’s Catholic faith should make him a natural middle-grounder, but his personal qualms about abortion have zero policy substance since he abandoned his support for the Hyde Amendment, and he’s planted himself to the left of secular Europe on transgender issues.

You see this on immigration. Biden is only now considering a Trump-like executive order on border crossings, several years after the border surge began.

And you especially see it on environmental issues, where the White House is reluctant to put any clear distance between itself and climate activists. On energy and automobiles, Biden could be doing the rough equivalent of what Trump is doing on abortion: Having delivered unprecedented green investments the way Trump delivered the end of Roe, he could now be spending most of his time touting America’s energy boom while promising the majority of Americans that they won’t be forced into an electric car.

Are We All Authoritarians at Heart?

Instead he has Pete Buttigieg, himself the kind of smooth-talking politician who should be good at triangulation, going on Fox News and comparing electric-vehicle skeptics to people who preferred landlines to cellphones 20 years ago. “If you like your gas-powered car, you can keep your car,” is a simple, politically effective formulation. Yet somehow the Biden administration has ended up with, “If you like your gas-powered car, you’re a clueless antiquarian” instead.

One explanation for this pattern is that Biden’s White House is staffed by progressive ideologues who don’t have an instinct for moderation and don’t give their aged boss enough freedom to maneuver. Another explanation is that Biden’s team is just deathly afraid of the progressive impulse toward self-sabotage, the willingness of left-wing factions to sit the election out or cast a protest vote.

I don’t think the latter fear is ungrounded. (Ralph Nader really did cost the Democrats a presidential election, after all.) But the Trump era has repeatedly demonstrated the limitations of a base mobilization strategy for Democrats, and there’s a difference between being aware of your base and being its prisoner.

The greater freedom that Trump enjoys has roots in some dark places — cynicism, conservative tribalism, a populist indifference to policy detail. But it’s still a freedom that Biden sorely needs.","California's state government, under the leadership of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, is pursuing a wide-ranging climate agenda targeting the transportation sector — actions that could have major economic implications.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB), the state's main environmental regulator, has finalized new rules mandating a rapid transition from traditional petroleum-powered modes of transportation to zero-emissions alternatives as it pursues a sweeping climate agenda. CARB has identified passenger cars, heavy-duty trucking, freight trains and harbor vessels for the changeover. 

""We can solve this climate crisis if we focus on the big, bold steps necessary to cut pollution,"" Newsom remarked in August 2022.

FEDERAL COURT STRIKES DOWN BIDEN'S CLIMATE RULE FOR STATES

The governor's comments came shortly after CARB finalized regulations phasing out new gas-powered cars, and mandating 100% electric vehicle sales by 2035. Nearly 20 other states have since adopted those rules, meaning more than 40% of the country will be impacted by the mandate to some extent.

Environmentalists nationwide have set their sights on transportation because of its high carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions, which they say are contributing to global warming. According to the latest state data, the transportation sector accounts for 39% of California's carbon emissions, the largest share of any sector and more than the industrial and power sectors combined.

The state's broad effort to electrify its transportation sector is part of the California Climate Commitment unveiled by Newsom two years ago. Under the plan, the state is phasing out reliance on fossil fuels, deploying green energy, cutting greenhouse gas emissions 85% by 2045 and decreasing oil demand by a staggering 94%.

TRUCKERS CHALLENGE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OVER CLIMATE CRACKDOWN ON ELECTRIC BIG RIGS

The new regulations have received widespread criticism from Republicans, Democrats, consumer groups and industry associations, which argue such a plan is unworkable and not feasible. In a recent federal filing, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major automakers and supports a transition to EVs, said it had ""continued concerns with the feasibility"" of the plan.

""CARB has an ideological commitment to reducing emissions from transportation,"" said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment. ""They particularly don't seem to like personal mobility, where people can go around anywhere they want in whatever kind of vehicle they want.

""So, they say people are just going to have to get used to electric vehicles, whether they like them or not, and go where the charging stations are. This seems to be an ideological, semi-religious, cultish viewpoint.""

FORMER AG WILLIAM BARR'S FREE MARKET GROUP SUES CALIFORNIA OVER EV TRUCK MANDATE

In 2023, 9.5% of new, light-duty vehicle sales were EVs, up from 7% in 2022 and 4.3% in 2021, according to data from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. California's regulations kick in next year, requiring 35% of model year 2026 car purchases to be electric and, one year later, requiring 43% of model year 2027 cars to be electric.

In addition to that mandate, CARB adopted the nation's most aggressive truck electrification plan in April 2023 and, shortly thereafter, regulations targeting freight train emissions. The former mandates wide swaths of the heavy-duty vehicle sector to be electrified by 2035, and the latter requires locomotives to begin transitioning to zero-emissions technology in 2030.

The American Trucking Associations blasted the heavy-duty vehicle rule, saying it sets ""unrealistic targets and unachievable timelines."" And the Association of American Railroads — which is suing California over the freight train regulations — said ""there is no clear path to zero emissions locomotives.""

""Commerce is the lifeblood of the economy and transportation of goods — most of which is by trucks and a lot of it also by train,"" Marlo Lewis, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said in an interview. ""An efficient economy would be one where the costs of transport are as low as possible, consistent with safety and real environmental concerns.""

FEWER AMERICANS WANT TO BUY AN EV — EVEN AS BIDEN PUSHES FOR STRONGEST-EVER CLIMATE CHANGE RULES

Lewis criticized CARB's rules targeting trucking and freight trains, saying it would have negative economic consequences and potentially lead to higher consumer prices.

The American Trucking Associations estimates that trucks transported a whopping 11.5 billion tons of freight in 2022, equivalent to about 72% of total tonnage shipped nationwide. But less than 1% of new truck sales in the U.S. are zero emissions, according to the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association. And those electric trucks remain far costlier than diesel-powered models, they say.

Additionally, freight railroads haul another 1.6 billion tons of raw materials and finished goods every year, data from the Association of American Railroads shows.

""At a qualitative level, this is going to increase the cost of national transportation services — private, commercial, industrial — enormously. There's just no doubt about that,"" said Benjamin Zycher, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

""Even if you assume and make wild assumptions about the benefits in terms of climate phenomena and all the rest, there's just no way the benefits exceed the cost. It's just impossible,"" he added.

MAINE REJECTS SWEEPING ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE IN BLOW TO GOVERNOR'S CLIMATE AGENDA

In addition, CARB recently amended its Commercial Harbor Craft regulation, requiring a wide array of vessels, including tugboats, towboats and barges, to install cleaner upgrades and newer technology. In particular, vessels must install diesel particulate filters, a major retrofit that has some groups concerned about safety. 

The American Waterways Operators (AWO), which represents the tugboat, towboat and barge industry, has opposed the regulation over concerns about diesel particulate filters (DPFs) catching fire. In her opinion piece in the DC Journal, Jennifer Carpenter, president and CEO of the AWO, wrote:

""While a truck driver can run from a fire, a vessel crew’s only option may be to abandon ship, which is hazardous and always a last resort. Introducing new fire risks to heavily trafficked ports with combustible cargoes is also dangerous — imagine the threats to safety, the environment and property if a DPF ignites on a tugboat carrying 110,000 barrels of fuel.""

And the U.S. Coast Guard penned a letter obtained by Politico in February, informing CARB that it would refuse to enforce the new mandate.

The vessel restrictions were also subject to a recent letter from a coalition of California Republicans led by Rep. Michelle Steel. The lawmakers called on CARB to delay implementation of the rules and consider stakeholder input.

""CARB seems hell-bent on further crippling our economy and burdening our workers,"" Steel told Fox News Digital. ""Whether it’s an absurd mandate that 100% of new car sales be zero-emission vehicles by 2035, or a downright dangerous requirement that towing vessels install faulty diesel particulate filters, CARB has repeatedly set forth regulations that defy logic and harm people.""

Rep. Jay Obernolte, R–Calif., called the CARB rule an ""overreach"" and ""nonsensical."" 

""In the case of towing vessels, CARB is relying on untested technology that our own Coast Guard has indicated they will not be able to enforce. And when it comes to locomotives, there are no freight locomotives available that comply with the zero-emissions requirement of the CARB regulation, and the physics of weight and energy density strongly suggest there will still be none when the regulation’s target of 2030 is reached,"" he said.

Lys Mendez, communications director for CARB, said in a statement that the board has entered into a ""Clean Truck Partnership"" with heavy-duty truck manufacturers like Ford, Daimler, General Motors, Isuzu, Navistar, Volvo and others in an effort to ""work toward shared goals around emissions reductions.""

""The benefits of a zero-emissions future are clear for Californians and the state continues to spur innovation that will bring better technology, savings and public health benefits for consumers,"" Mendez said. ""All of CARB's regulations are developed as part of a rigorous and thorough public process, which includes significant engagement from interested parties such as regulated industries and consumers. As part of every rulemaking, CARB conducts a financial analysis, which includes an assessment of costs, cost-savings, and benefits — including from public health benefits such as reduced illness, hospitalization and death due to cleaner air.""","Congressional leaders from both parties were quick to condemn Iran’s retaliatory strikes on Israel this Saturday but still remain at odds on how to pass additional Israel funding in wake of the attacks.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday he will move forward with a vote on additional Israel aid but did not go into specifics about his plans as he walks a knife’s edge with conservatives over the potential inclusion of Ukraine funding.

“The House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel. We’re going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together right now. We’re looking at the options and all these supplemental issues,” Johnson told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures.”

But hardline conservatives are warning Johnson against attaching Ukraine funding to any Israel aid package, underscoring the competing pressures on the speaker as he weighs critical decisions about the path ahead following Iran’s attack on Israel.

“Congress should be clear: no action by Iran or Israel merits a vote on the Ukraine omnibus the Senate seeks,” GOP Rep. Warren Davidson wrote on social media.

The pressure campaign from Johnson’s right flank comes amid bipartisan calls — including from GOP Leader Mitch McConnell — to take up the Senate-passed foreign package that includes money for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, arguing that is the fastest way to get aid to Israel.

Johnson has vowed to put some sort of Israel aid bill on the floor this week, but said the details are still being finalized. The House GOP Conference will meet Monday evening to discuss the Iran-Israel situation and their legislative plans going forward, according to GOP sources.

It all amounts to a complicated calculation for Johnson. The House previously struggled to pass a standalone Israel aid bill, but Johnson could draw ire from the right if he ties it to Ukraine or puts the Senate bill on the floor.

The speaker has, however, been trying to get former President Donald Trump’s crucial buy-in for a more GOP-friendly Ukraine aid package, such as structuring the aid as a loan — which Trump signaled openness to during a press conference with Johnson at Mar-a-Lago.

President Joe Biden participated in a call with congressional leadership on Sunday afternoon to discuss the “urgent need” for the House to pass the bipartisan Senate-passed aid package.

“The President discussed the urgent need for the House of Representatives to pass the national security supplemental as soon as possible,” the White House said Sunday.

McConnell, Johnson, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries all participated in the call, according to the White House.

At a news conference Sunday, Schumer urged the GOP-led House to move on the Senate-passed aid package in the wake of the Iranian attack. “The best way to help Israel and to help Ukraine is to pass the supplemental this week,” Schumer said, according to a transcript provided by his office. “I’ve called on Speaker Johnson to do that.”

The House has thus far declined to take a vote on the Senate-passed legislation, with many House conservatives opposed to sending additional aid to Ukraine and wanting stricter US southern border policies included in any aid package. But it’s unclear how the Democrat-controlled Senate would approach whatever legislation comes from the GOP-led House.

Individual members have also weighed in on the conflict since the Iranian attacks on Israel, with Democrats imploring Johnson to bring up the Senate foreign aid package as many Republicans call on Schumer to act on Israel only.

Responding to calls from McConnell for the House to bring to the floor the $95.3 billion supplemental foreign aid package that passed the Senate in February, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio sidestepped, insisting on Sunday that the Senate could pass standalone aid to Israel and win House approval.

“We could go on Monday to Washington, DC, and we can pass aid to Israel right away,” Rubio told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union,” adding: “If the Senate were to send the House an Israel aid bill on Monday, the House will pass it.”

Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, highlighting the time-sensitive nature of the issue, called on Johnson to bring the supplemental foreign aid package passed by the Senate in February to the floor on Monday.

“I think the most important deterrent action that Congress can take … is for Speaker Johnson to not take days or weeks to try and come up with some other package but to pass the supplemental tomorrow,” Coons told Tapper in a separate interview.

How Congress reached this point
While the Senate passed its foreign aid bill in February, Johnson said he never planned to bring the bill to the floor. The House, in turn, tried but failed to pass a standalone package for $17.6 billion in Israel aid amid opposition from both Republicans and Democratic leaders.

Because of resistance among members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Johnson had been forced to bring up the bill under a procedure that requires a two-thirds majority of the House to approve it. That means he needed the support of a sizable number of Democrats to get behind it, and failed to cross that threshold. At a closed caucus meeting prior to the vote, House Democratic leadership made a forceful case against supporting the standalone Israel aid package to members.

However, given the attacks by Iran and its proxies, leadership in both chambers are under increased pressure to reach a consensus.

CNN’s Samantha Waldenberg, Haley Talbot, Lauren Fox, Manu Raju, Aileen Graef and Avery Lotz contributed to this report.","The opening of Donald Trump’s first criminal trial on Monday will put to the test a defense strategy his lawyers have been honing for a year — a confrontational gambit that has angered the judge and could cost the presidential candidate dearly when it comes to a verdict.

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.
Fight for every scrap of evidence. Push for every possible delay. The approach has succeeded so far in Trump’s three other pending criminal cases, potentially pushing all of them into or past November’s presidential election. Surprisingly it is in Manhattan, at a courthouse notorious for lengthy delays before many criminal trials, that the former president and presumptive Republican nominee will face his first judgment day.

Trump’s defense strategy in New York is unique from the other three cases in one respect — he aims to deny involvement in the key conversations about hush money payments made through his former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, according to people familiar with his plan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

Prosecutors who have charged him with falsifying business records say the details of those conversations will help prove that Trump illegally categorized his reimbursement of Cohen as a legal fee, rather than a campaign expense. The purpose of the payments, prosecutors say, was to conceal from voters in 2016 any allegations of an extramarital tryst with Stormy Daniels, an adult-film star.

In Florida, where Trump is charged with mishandling classified documents — and in D.C. and Georgia, where he is charged with obstructing election results — his lawyers have argued in essence that Trump engaged in the conduct at issue but that the conduct did not amount to crimes. He has pleaded not guilty in all four cases.

Denial is only one part of Trump’s New York strategy; delay is another. Three times last week his lawyers raced to an appeals court seeking to stall the looming trial; three times their appeals were rejected.

“He believes, as a matter of policy, all the cases should be after the election,” said David Schoen, a former Trump lawyer.

Many people facing trial do everything they can to slow the process down, knowing that witnesses’ memories can fade, prosecutors can change jobs or public interest can evaporate. What Trump brings to such delay efforts is a megaphone and a novel argument — the unprecedented nature of putting a former president and current candidate on trial, and the still-murky possibility of get-out-of-jail free cards should he be reelected.

“Virtually all criminal defendants out on bail seek to delay their trial forever, and judges and prosecutors know that defendants for the most part have to be dragged kicking and screaming to trial,” said Ron Kuby, a veteran defense lawyer in New York.

The most surprising thing about Trump’s delay tactics, Kuby said, is that they haven’t worked well in New York compared with those of so many other defendants.

Trump is also trying to denigrate his accusers — including New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan, District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and key witnesses such as Cohen and Daniels.

Again, Trump stands out from other criminal defendants — even famous ones — in that his incessant trashing of the justice system and the people involved in charging him appear to have boosted his standing in polls and rallied his Republican base.

“Attacking the system, the fairness of it, the motives of the people prosecuting you, that is not new,” Kuby said. “But never before in history has somebody been as successful at it as Donald Trump, in terms of massive agreement with his message. I’ve never seen that before in any case with any defendant.”

Merchan has grown increasingly frustrated with Trump’s bids for delays, voicing particular displeasure with Trump’s lead lawyer, Todd Blanche.

When Blanche was hired a year ago, he told other lawyers on the defense team that the immediate goal was to slow all the criminal cases down, according to people familiar with his edict, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

The lawyers intensified their efforts to draft numerous pretrial motions in every case, poring over each indictment for anything that would drag the process out with responses, hearings, rulings and appeals.

In many court proceedings, opposing lawyers stipulate to basic facts to avoid wasting time on minor details that aren’t really disputed. On Trump’s legal team, a decision was made to stipulate to nothing — and fight over everything, according to the people familiar with the discussions.

One of Blanche’s partners, Emil Bove, took a particular interest in the classified documents case, where Trump’s team has been pleased by Judge Aileen M. Cannon’s pace in making rulings — even when they were not favorable to Trump. The case has been delayed indefinitely while the judge considers motions involving the handling of classified evidence and multiple defense claims that Trump should not have been charged. The legal team plans to wage a battle over every single classified document, people with knowledge of the strategy say.

On Saturday, Trump’s lawyers filed papers asking Cannon to push back a May 9 deadline she recently set for new submissions in the case — arguing that they would need at least a week to prepare inside a highly secure classified evidence room, at a time when they have to be on trial in New York. The filing seeks to push back the deadline until three weeks after the New York trial ends.

Special counsel Jack Smith’s legal team quickly objected to any delay, writing: “Each time the Court sets a new deadline in this case and attempts to keep it moving toward trial, the defendants reflexively ask for an adjournment. That must stop.”

The Georgia case also has been slowed by a host of motions to dismiss and was temporarily derailed by allegations of misconduct by the Fulton County district attorney. Trump’s federal election obstruction case in D.C. is on hold, meanwhile, while the Supreme Court weighs his claim of immunity.

When the Trump defense team strategized over the 2024 court calendar, they were least concerned about the New York case, the people familiar with the conversations said. But they won a temporary reprieve there also, thanks to a different part of their legal strategy: making far-reaching demands for access to potential evidence held by the government.

Originally scheduled to begin in March, the trial was pushed back to mid-April after federal prosecutors — who had previously charged Cohen and examined the Daniels payment — suddenly turned over more than 100,000 pages of material.

Trump’s team had subpoenaed the documentation from federal prosecutors, asking for far more than the local district attorney had originally sought.

Once those stacks of documents were provided, the defense argued that local prosecutors had not lived up to their obligations.

Trump’s lawyers demanded — and were granted — a trial delay to review the material. His lawyers have made similarly far-reaching demands for potential evidence in the other cases, and it remains to be seen whether those efforts will be fruitful for his defense team.

In New York, the strategy came with a cost: Merchan lost patience with Blanche’s accusations of prosecutorial wrongdoing. He demanded to know why the lawyer, himself a former federal prosecutor, had not subpoenaed the material months earlier.

The judge chastised Blanche for what he called “a pattern where I read certain information, I hear certain information and then I hear your interpretation of that, and it’s really different from my interpretation. And this has been frankly going on for months.”

TRUMP'S NEW YORK HUSH MONEY TRIAL
Next

Barring another last-ditch attempt to delay, Trump will walk into Manhattan criminal court on Monday, and lawyers will begin picking a jury.

The defendant’s immense public profile and his sharply polarizing nature will make that process difficult, said Jeffrey Bellin, a law professor at William & Mary and former federal prosecutor in D.C. — not because jurors shouldn’t know who Trump is or have an opinion of him, but because jurors should not let those opinions influence their decision-making.

“I can’t think of a similar American trial in recent times with as difficult of jury selection as this is going to be,” Bellin said. “There are other trials with famous defendants, say, the Bill Cosby trial or cases like that. But there are people who don’t have any strong feelings about Bill Cosby … they’re not going to feel strongly that he’s innocent or guilty, in the way that a lot of people not only know who Donald Trump is but have strong feelings about what should happen in these cases.”

In the city that made Trump famous, but where he is now deeply unpopular, his legal team is aiming as much for a mistrial as anything else, according to people familiar with the defense strategy. Criminal defense lawyers like to say that prosecutors need to convince 12 people in the jury box, but defendants only need to convince one, and that may be especially true in the Trump case.

Trump’s ongoing commentary on the case might be aimed at shaping public perceptions, including for prospective jurors, Bellin said. It carries risks, however. Defendants don’t typically lash out at judges, which can come back to bite them during sentencing. Denigrating the case and those involved in it could also frustrate the jury.

In a civil trial earlier this year in Manhattan, Trump’s demeanor and behavior did not seem to go over well with the jury, which ordered him to pay $83 million to the writer E. Jean Carroll after she accused him of sexually assaulting her and sued him for defamation.

As he sat in the courtroom, Trump occasionally grumbled, complained and fumed — so much so that the judge threatened to throw Trump out for defying his orders to keep quiet while Carroll testified.

Trump is already starting the hush money trial on thin ice with Merchan, who has imposed a gag order prohibiting Trump from criticizing witnesses, court staff members and certain others. Nevertheless, the former president is expected to speak often outside court, as he did during a separate civil business fraud trial brought by Attorney General Letitia James (D).

In that case, James won a judgment of nearly half a billion dollars against him.
","The US House speaker, Mike Johnson, has said he will aim to advance a bill for wartime aid to Israel this week following Iran’s weekend attack, but did not clarify whether Ukraine funding would be part of the package.

US assistance for both nations has languished amid political bickering in Congress, with Johnson – an ally of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump – blocking an earlier $95bn in aid sought by President Joe Biden for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan which had passed the Senate.

“The House Republicans and the Republican party understand the necessity of standing with Israel,” Johnson told Fox News. “We’re going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together right now.

“We’re looking at the options on all these supplemental issues.”

Johnson is already under immense political pressure from his fellow Republicans, who are divided in their support for helping Ukraine. Trump and far-right lawmakers in the House of Representatives have grown sceptical of pouring billions of dollars into Kyiv’s fight against Russia’s invading forces.

Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has threatened to oust Johnson as speaker over issues including his support for Ukraine.

The attack by Iran on Israel early on Sunday further ratcheted up the pressure on Johnson, but also gave him an opportunity to underscore the urgency of approving the funding.

The White House and top Democrats and Republicans in the Senate called on Johnson to approve the $95bn bipartisan package which has already passed the Senate that would provide $14.1bn in aid to Israel and $60bn to Ukraine.

“They should put it on the floor as soon as possible,” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told NBC.

Johnson has over recent months refused to take up the Senate bill. Instead, he has sought to craft his own legislation, with Ukraine aid structured as a loan at Trump’s behest.

The speaker met with Trump in Florida on Friday. On Sunday Johnson told Fox he was considering structuring the aid to Ukraine as a loan, as Trump has suggested and which Johnson said “I think has a lot of consensus”.

Several House conservatives have said they want stricter US migration policies added to any security aid package.

Biden, meanwhile, participated in a call with congressional leaders including Johnson on Sunday to address the “urgent need” for the House to approve the bipartisan aid package passed by the Senate.

“On the call, the president discussed the urgent need for the House of Representatives to pass the national security supplemental as soon as possible,” the White House said in a statement.

Republican Mike Turner, chair of the House intelligence committee, said on NBC’s Meet the Press that he expected the House would pass a broad aid bill this week.

“I think it will have overwhelming support, both the Ukraine, Israel and Asia packages, not just because of what’s happened with Iran escalating the conflict in the Middle East but because these are allies that need and deserve our support.”

Reuters, the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report","Two weeks ago, tensions between Israel and Iran reached a new level when Israel launched an attack on Iran’s consulate in Damascus. The move had its intended effect: Israel killed multiple IRGC Quds Force commanders. It followed, among other things, clashes between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah militants based in Lebanon, in addition to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack.

The question wasn’t whether Iran would retaliate for the attack in Syria. Rather, the world waited to see when and how Tehran would respond. The answer came into focus over the weekend: On Saturday, Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel.

Iranian officials must’ve realized that the offensive wouldn’t have much of an effect on the ground — and it didn’t. NBC News reported that defense systems thwarted the attack, and while there was some damage to an air base and a nearby road, operations at the base were not affected.

According to the latest accounts, no one was killed by the Iranian drones and missiles. Dan Drezner, a professor of international politics at Tufts University, called it ""a flashy-yet-militarily-inconsequential"" move.

This, in turn, has led to follow-up questions of how Israel will respond to Iran’s response, though it appears the White House has a preferred course of action. A Politico report noted, “[A] person familiar with the U.S.-Israeli conversation said Biden essentially told Netanyahu to ‘take the win’ given that Israel escaped the attack largely unscathed.”

A follow-up Politico report added:

The Biden administration’s main message for Israel following Iran’s aerial assault comes down to this: Stop and think. U.S. officials expect Israel to respond in some fashion to Saturday’s strikes, but in both public and private ways they are taking steps they hope will convince Israel to choose a limited response as opposed to an all-out armed counter-attack.

A New York Times report noted that it’s not just the White House: “[T]he Group of 7 nations, the European Union and the U.N. secretary general were among those counseling restraint.”

Some congressional Republicans, however, appear to have a different approach in mind. Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, for example, said via social media that the United States “must move quickly and launch aggressive retaliatory strikes on Iran.”

That seems extraordinarily unlikely, especially as Biden endorses a diplomatic course. That said, the matter clearly has Congress’ attention.

“In light of Iran’s unjustified attack on Israel, the House will move from its previously announced legislative schedule next week to instead consider legislation that supports our ally Israel and holds Iran and its terrorist proxies accountable,” said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise in a statement.

The votes on the GOP’s absurd bills related to home appliances will apparently have to wait.","As Israel on Monday weighed its response to Iran's stunning attacks this weekend, the U.S. is privately telling officials there: If Israel strikes back militarily, it will do so alone.

It's an unusual message for a close ally that's spent decades receiving more US military aid than any other country in the world and whose relationship with America is often described as ""ironclad.""

But after months of Israel acting on its own in Gaza -- and facing tough criticism from the U.S. and other allies that its military operations have gone too far – the Biden administration made clear the U.S. wouldn't participate in offensive military operations against Iran, fearing a broader war in the Middle East.

""We believe Israel has freedom of action to protect itself and defend itself,"" a senior administration official told reporters shortly after Iran's attack ended. ""That's a long-standing policy, and that remains.""

When asked by a reporter if the U.S. would help Israel counter with offensive military operations, the official said no.

""We would not envision ourselves participating in such a thing,"" this person said.

According to a second U.S. official, that message was also delivered directly to Israel's top officials in a private phone call Sunday between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.

In addition to expressing support for Israel's defense, the official said Austin made clear in a very ""direct"" manner that the U.S. was not planning to join a potential counteroffensive on Israel's behalf.

Iran's attack on Israel late Saturday had deeply rattled world leaders, including U.S. officials who initially thought the Islamic Republic had readied only a dozen or so ballistic missiles. One senior U.S. official described their hand ""trembling"" while taking notes in a meeting upon learning that U.S. intelligence believed more than 100 ballistic missiles being prepared for launch.

The attack was considered retaliation for a military strike on what Iran called its consulate in Damascus, Syria, widely believed to be Israel's doing.

In the end, U.S. officials estimate that Iran launched some 300 missiles and drones, including more than 100 ballistic missiles and 30 cruise missiles.

Two U.S. officials confirm to ABC News that about half of those missiles either failed to launch, failed in flight or crashed before reaching their targets in Israel.

Israeli's air defense systems were successful in defeating the majority of the remaining air threats, with U.S., U.K. and Jordanian forces coming to their aid.

According to U.S. Central Command, American forces in the region – including two U.S. Navy destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea -- shot down some 80 drones and up to six ballistic missiles. One missile was shot down near Erbil, Iraq, by U.S. forces who suspected it was headed toward Israel.

The senior administration official told reporters afterward the defensive effort was a ""spectacular"" success, even if Iran's intent ""clearly was to cause significant damage and deaths in Israel.""

Israel's response wasn't immediately clear. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with his war cabinet on Sunday, and top officials said a decision could be made as early as Monday.

President Joe Biden had already spoken privately with Netanyahu within hours of the attack. Biden later joined G7 leaders on Sunday in a statement expressing ""full solidarity and support to Israel.""

""I think coming together in such a very, very strong way under the umbrella of the United States Central Command, together with the British, together with the French and the regional players, sent a very, very clear message to Iran that you can't get away with it,"" said Israel's Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Force.

That global support for Israel was a notable shift for Israel after months of criticism its destructive military operations against Hamas following the Oct. 7 attacks. Israel has defended the offensive operation as necessary to defend itself against future attacks.

US officials said that they believe Iran's attack late Saturday was mostly a failure, and the goal now should be a carefully calibrated response with broad international support.

""I think Israel has to think through carefully what it does next,"" the senior administration official said.

Justice Clarence Thomas absent from Supreme Court arguments Monday with no reason given
By Melissa Quinn

April 15, 2024 / 1:44 PM EDT / CBS News

Washington — Justice Clarence Thomas did not attend oral arguments at the Supreme Court on Monday, and no reason was given for his absence.

As the justices convened to hear arguments in two cases, Chief Justice John Roberts announced that Thomas would not be taking the bench but would ""participate fully,"" based on the briefs and transcripts from the proceedings. No further information about Thomas was given.

At 75 years of age, Thomas is the oldest member of the court and its longest-serving current justice, having joined the Supreme Court in 1991. He missed several days of arguments in March 2022, spending a week in the hospital after being admitted with an infection.

Justices have in the past missed oral arguments but still participate in cases based on the briefs filed and transcripts. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was absent from six days of arguments while she recovered from lung cancer surgery in late 2018, which marked her first time missing the proceedings in 25 years.","Imagine grudgingly schlepping to the courthouse after receiving a jury duty letter in the mail, only to find the place under heightened security with multiple rallies outside for the first day of Donald Trump's criminal trial hush money.

That is what approximately 500 Manhattan residents called for jury duty faced Monday morning. The lawyers in the case are starting to question a batch of potential 96 jurors Monday afternoon in the quest to find 12 people and a few alternates without opinions about the former president.

Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records for allegedly disguising hush money payments issued to porn star Stormy Daniels. He has pleaded not guilty, but the jury will decide the outcome.

What will it take to be selected as a juror for the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president? Here is what we know:

Potential jurors asked to answer 42 questions
Judge Juan Merchan decided on the following list of questions that jurors will be asked orally in court, and both Trump's team and prosecutors will have the opportunity to ask follow-up questions:


Juror questions meant to tease out political preferences, lawyers may double check answers
While lawyers can't ask if jurors voted for Trump or plan to vote for Trump, several other questions on the list may tease out their political leanings. For example:

""Have you, a relative, or a close friend ever worked or volunteered for a Trump presidential campaign, the Trump presidential administration, or any other political entity affiliated with Mr. Trump?
""Have you ever considered yourself a supporter of or belonged to any of the following:
the QAnon movement
Proud Boys
Oathkeepers
Three Percenters
Boogaloo Boys
Antifa
""Do you have any feelings of opinions about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case?""
Experts previously told USA TODAY that the legal teams will be checking the jurors social media profiles to see if they can assess truthfulness and intentions.

There are three basic outcomes from a jury trial: the jury convicts the defendant, the jury acquits the defendant, or the jury ""hangs"" − meaning jurors can't come to an agreement and the judge is forced to declare a mistrial. Unlike when a defendant is acquitted, prosecutors are able to re-try defendants after mistrials.

As USA TODAY previously reported, retrials don't always happen. That means Trump's team may be looking for a juror who is willing to go against the grain and prevent consensus.

How will the juror pool be whittled down?

If potential jurors' answers indicate they probably will not be impartial in the case, Merchan has said he will strike them from consideration.

For any potential jurors Merchan does not excuse from further service, the two sides will have the option of disqualifying them through one of the limited number of ""peremptory strikes"" they each have. Those strikes function like vetoes over prospective jurors.","
A photo of four uniformed Marines posing at Mar-a-Lago that went viral didn't happen at a political fundraiser and had no connection with former President Donald Trump or his White House bid, the service announced.

In a statement on X, the service said the Marines — reserve members of the 4th Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company — were at Mar-a-Lago on April 11 as part of a color guard for an event hosted by the Grey Team, a nonprofit aimed at preventing military suicides.

“The request was reviewed by Marine Forces Reserve Community Relations and deemed eligible for support,” the service stated. “The event was open to the public and helped raise awareness about military and veteran suicides. The event was neither a political fundraiser, nor was the 45th President of the United States in attendance.”

Military Times noted Mar-a-Lago — a hub for Trump's campaign operations — often hosts nonpolitical events as well.

Though the Marines were approved to participate in the Grey Team event, photos of people posing with them raised worries the Marines may have violated Department of Defense rules about participation in political events, the outlet reported.

According to Marine Times, using uniformed service members to support nonprofit fundraisers and other big events is common — though they require a review by senior leaders.

DOD rules ban service members from appearing in uniform at rallies, protests, or other political events where they could appear to be representing the armed services. 

Last month, the National Guard investigated after a Texas adjutant general ran afoul of military politicking rules by appearing in uniform alongside Trump during a campaign event at the southern border, Military Times reported.

Pentagon leaders in 2020 updated rules on participating in political events."
"The Supreme Court is hurting.

I can say that with confidence — not based on any inside information but on the external evidence of how hard some of the justices are working to show that everyone on the court really does get along.

“When we disagree, our pens are sharp, but on a personal level, we never translate that into our relationship with one another,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor told an audience at the National Governors Association conference in February. “We don’t raise our voices, no matter how hot-button the case is,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett said at the civics forum at George Washington University in March.

The retired justice Stephen Breyer, on the talk circuit for his new book on constitutional interpretation, has been making the same point. In a guest essay in The Times this month, he observed that “justices who do not always agree on legal results nonetheless agree to go to hockey games or play golf together.” He added: “The members of the court can and do get along well personally. That matters.”

Does it?

I’m reminded of the last time the court made a concerted effort to assure the public that all was well. It was during the weeks that followed the ruling that clinched the 2000 presidential election for George W. Bush. With the court in recess, justices who had voted on either side of that 5-to-4 decision, Bush v. Gore, scattered around the country and the world (Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg went to Australia), taking the occasion of previously scheduled lectures to claim that the court was not in crisis.

Justice Ginsburg and Justice Antonin Scalia, bitterly opposed in that case and in a good many others, let it be known that they had kept up their tradition of New Year’s Eve dinner together with their spouses. “The justices are behaving almost like survivors of a natural disaster who need to talk about what happened in order to regain their footing and move on,” I wrote at the time.

Now, by contrast, there is no single issue, no giant iceberg that the court has struck, but rather separate disconcerting developments that have noticeably dented the court’s once secure public standing.

Was it the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that erased the constitutional right to abortion and upended state politics in much of the country? The astonishing leak of a draft of the Dobbs decision, which Justice Clarence Thomas called “tremendously bad” and destabilizing for the court? The controversy over the court’s seeming inability to bind itself to a judicial ethics code? The abrupt emergence of a conservative supermajority flexing its muscles so forcefully that Justice Barrett, before reaching her first anniversary on the court, felt driven to declare publicly that “this court is not composed of a bunch of partisan hacks”?

It may be a bit of each of these or none of them, but the inventory itself suggests that what matters is what the court does or doesn’t do: that the legacy of the Roberts court will reside in the pages of United States Reports, the official compilation of Supreme Court decisions, and not in the justices’ datebooks. What counts is not how the justices treat one another but how they treat the claims of those who come before them.

I’m still shaking my head, for example, over a decision from several terms ago that stripped two laywomen, teachers in elementary parochial schools, of the protection of federal anti-discrimination laws because, the 7-to-2 majority held, they were effectively “ministers” who fell under a rule the court adopted eight years earlier called the ministerial exception to ordinary civil laws. The women had no substantial religious training. One did not have her contract renewed after she revealed that she needed time off for treatment of breast cancer. The Americans With Disabilities Act did her no good. By the time the court decided the case, she had died.

The Supreme Court and other appellate courts are categorized in the judicial literature as collegial courts. “Collegial” in that usage is a term of art. It doesn’t mean that the judges necessarily get along. It means that these multimember courts act as collectives, when a majority coalesces. In a forthcoming memoir, “Vision,” Judge David Tatel, who recently retired from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, offers as good a definition of judicial collegiality as I have seen. “Judicial collegiality,” he writes, “has nothing to do with singing holiday songs, having lunch or attending basketball games together. It has everything to do with respecting each other, listening to each other and sometimes even changing our minds.”

Years ago, Mark Alan Stamaty used a “Washingtoon,” his cartoon that ran regularly in The Washington Post, to depict the Supreme Court justices walking in single file, each carrying a bundle. “The Supreme Court Goes to the Laundromat” was the title. I thought it was so funny that I kept it for years tacked to the New York Times cubicle in the Supreme Court pressroom. It portrayed, to be sure, a collegial Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court is set to consider a second abortion case this term, this time dealing with claims by a Republican-led state that the Biden administration is attempting to wield a 40-year-old federal law as an ""abortion mandate.""

On the heels of a debate over the Federal Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of an abortion pill, the high court will consider later this month whether the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) pre-empts the state of Idaho’s newly enacted Defense of Life Act – which makes it a crime for any medical provider to perform an abortion with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.  

The Justice Department argued that the state’s law does not go far enough to allow abortions in more medical emergency circumstances.

However, proponents of the state law say that the administration's lawsuit against Idaho is attempting to use a federal statute as an ""abortion mandate"" to benefit the president ahead of the 2024 elections.

WHY TRUMP IS DEFERRING TO THE STATES, AFTER WEIGHING AN ABORTION BAN AT 15 WEEKS

""Construing EMTALA as a federal abortion mandate raises grave questions under the major questions doctrine that affect both Congress and this Court,"" Idaho argued in legal filings. 

In an interview with Fox News Digital, Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador said, ""The Supreme Court made it clear that it’s up to the states to decide what our laws should be and that it's not for the federal government."" 

""But Joe Biden and his administration decided to come straight and sue us in federal courts.  We are excited to go before the Supreme Court to show that the state should be deciding these issues and not the federal government,"" he said.

The DOJ said in its response to the high court that while Idaho’s law makes it a felony for a doctor to terminate a pregnancy unless doing so is ""necessary"" to prevent the patient’s ""death,"" that exception is ""narrower"" than EMTALA, which by its terms ""protects patients not only from imminent death but also from emergencies that seriously threaten their health."" 

However, Idaho accused the administration of ""construing the spare phrase"" in the federal law ""as a blank slate to be filled with the Executive Branch’s preferred abortion policy collides with multiple statutory provisions guaranteeing emergency medical care for a pregnant woman and her unborn child."" 

""It’s clear that the administration is just manipulating EMTALA and that both laws should be able to coexist,"" John Busch, senior litigator at civil rights firm Alliance Defending Freedom and co-counsel in the case, told Fox News Digital in an interview.

""If a woman's life is in danger, Idaho’s Defense of Life Act makes it clear that the women should be treated and helped. Because in that instance, when the mom's life is in danger, it's not an abortion in Idaho or any of the other 49 states,"" he said.

But the White House says that the 21 states enforcing abortion bans are causing ""chaos and confusion.""

""These extreme state laws have caused chaos and confusion, and women are being denied the essential care they need. But these dangerous state laws do not change the responsibility that health care providers have to their patients in emergencies covered by the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act,"" White House spokesperson Kelly Scully told Fox News Digital.

""The Biden-Harris Administration has long been clear that federal law requires hospitals to offer health and life-saving care to patients in an emergency. The Administration remains focused on working with doctors, hospitals, and patients to make these federal requirements clear while the Department of Justice defends that understanding in the Supreme Court. No woman should be denied the care she needs,"" she said. 

PRO-LIFE CONSERVATIVES ARE 'DISAPPOINTED' IN TRUMP'S NEW ABORTION POLICY, BUT STICK BY HIM: 'ONLY ONE OPTION'

EMTALA is a federal statute signed by then-President Reagan in 1986 after earning bipartisan congressional support, designed to prevent hospitals from turning away indigent patients who are in critical need of medical care and offer the same ""stabilizing"" care they would to a patient who could pay or is covered by insurance.

After the Dobbs decision in 2022, which overturned Roe v. Wade and left states to decide their own abortion limitations, Bursch said the Biden administration, for the first time in the law’s history, used it to impose an ""abortion mandate.""

A district court sided with DOJ and ordered a preliminary injunction of the state’s law. The Ninth Circuit affirmed that decision, which Idaho then appealed to the Supreme Court. Oral arguments are set for April 24. 

""What the Biden administration wants to do is take this law and turn it into an abortion enclave in emergency rooms,"" Bursch said. ""And to the point where even if a patient came in, and they said that they were in critical condition because of a mental health problem, like depression, or anxiety, that would give doctors a carte blanche ability to ignore laws like Idaho's and take the life of the innocent child, and EMTALA doesn't say anything like that."" 

REPUBLICANS LARGELY QUIET AS DEMOCRATS HAMMER SCOTUS ABORTION PILL CHALLENGE

Bursch added that what he believes is ""so ironic"" is that following the Dobbs decision, President Biden himself said that he disagreed with the decision, but that he understood that states operating through the democratic process would get to decide what abortion laws would control each state. 

""And it was only a matter of weeks later that he changed course and said, ‘oh no, the federal government is just going to impose this new requirement by reinterpreting EMTALA in a way that it's never been interpreted in its nearly four-decade history.""

 ""It is subverting states' rights. It’s pushing abortion on states that don't want it, and it's all blatantly illegal,"" he said.

Stephen Billy, vice president of state affairs for SBA Pro-Life America, said the administration’s novel legal challenge to a state’s abortion law looks politically motivated ahead of the November elections amid Biden’s dwindling poll numbers. 

""The Biden administration doesn't feel like they have any other issue to run on, and it's clear what they're going to talk about and what they're trying to run on. Whether abortion is going to be a campaign issue or not, the Biden administration is going to try to make it one,"" he added.

Billy cited the Women’s Health Protection Act, which Democrats in Congress attempted to pass last year. It would have legalized virtually limitless abortion nationwide, but ultimately failed.

""Congress's opposition to that comes from the will of the people who sent the elected representatives to D.C., and they have very little national support when you look at the polling for the extreme position of the Women's Health Protection Act,"" said Billy.

""So Biden turned to executive action, ignoring the text of laws and just trying to use executive fiat to expand abortion on demand wherever you can, and however you can. And EMTALA is just one example of that,"" he said. 

Billy added that he believes the Biden administration is using ""fear and scare tactics"" around the issue. 

""The entire case is basically a claim that women can't get medical care,"" he said, but noted that every ""pro-life state"" allows for a mother’s health exception and allows doctors to act when there’s a medical emergency. 

""They are trying to use that fear to drive a political agenda and to save their campaign because they don't really have anything else to run on,"" he said. 

The Justice Department declined to comment on pending litigation.","Special counsel Jack Smith told the federal judge overseeing Donald Trump’s classified documents case she should reject the former president’s attempt to use his first criminal trial, set to begin Monday in New York, to try to delay facing a jury over the more serious federal charges in Florida.

In Trump’s latest effort to capitalize on colliding court schedules, the 2024 presumptive Republican nominee asked US District Judge Aileen Cannon on Saturday to push back a May deadline for reviewing classified evidence in the criminal case over his alleged mishandling of classified and sensitive government information stored at his Mar-a-Lago estate.

Trump can’t meet the deadline, his lawyers said in a filing, because he’ll be on trial for state charges in Manhattan. That trial — over allegations that Trump falsified business records to conceal hush money payments to cover up an alleged affair with an adult film star before the 2016 election — could last into June.

But Trump and his primary defense lawyers, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, can’t be in two places at once, they said.

“President Trump has a constitutional right to be present at the trial in New York and, as a result, cannot participate in this work relating to important parts of his defense,” Trump’s attorneys wrote in the filing to Cannon.

Smith countered in a Sunday evening court filing that, while Trump has a constitutional right to counsel, that “right is not boundless.”

Smith said Trump’s attorneys have had more than enough time to prepare to meet the May 9 deadline for reviewing the classified materials in the federal documents case. Smith also noted that Trump has local lawyers in Florida who can continue to review the classified materials while the New York hush money trial is underway.

“Each time the Court sets a new deadline in this case and attempts to keep it moving toward trial, the defendants reflexively ask for an adjournment. That must stop,” Smith said.

As the former president’s legal team steps into the Manhattan courtroom Monday, work in the Mar-a-Lago documents case will grind to a near-total halt. The classified documents case has stalled in Florida federal court, and Trump’s defense team has already dramatically reduced the amount of time they’ve spent working on the criminal case over the last six weeks.

Cannon, who is overseeing the case, has not yet set a trial date, has few other deadlines on the calendar and has a backlog of legal disputes she has yet to resolve.

Moreover, the sensitive nature of information handled in the case makes it difficult for attorneys to continue any work outside Florida. The next phase of their work requires extensive discussions between Trump and his legal team in a secure facility in remote Fort Pierce, Florida, people familiar with Trump’s legal team said.

In the filing Saturday, Trump’s attorneys said that meeting the deadline to review evidence “will require lengthy classified submissions and extensive time in a SCIF to prepare and discuss those submissions, which is time President Trump and his attorneys simply do not have during the trial that is about to begin in New York.”

Federal prosecutors from the special counsel’s office are also attempting to keep up the pressure on the case in Florida, making clear to Cannon that they believe Trump’s team should be prepared for their arguments over classified records in the defense case already.

“They have had the classified discovery for months now … they are well steeped in it,” prosecutor Jay Bratt said in a March hearing, adding that the fight over classified documents is “what leads to how the case can be presented at trial.”

In his filing Saturday, Trump’s lawyers said that the special counsel’s office indicated that they “cannot agree” with the request to push back deadlines.","Iran’s drone and missile attacks on Israel this weekend added fresh urgency to the long-stalled congressional effort to secure more aid for a U.S. ally, but as the House returns to session on Monday, there is little clarity on what type of aid package Republicans will take up.

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.
Sharp divisions within the Republican Party have kept a Senate-approved, bipartisan $95 billion national security package that includes aid to Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel from being taken up in the House. Although several lawmakers expressed optimism on Sunday that an Israel aid package will quickly pass in Congress, any legislation that is different from that version would have to go back to the Senate for approval. It’s unclear if such a new measure would garner enough support among a fractious House GOP conference, and it would be likely to face opposition in the Senate if passed via partisan margins, as it had before.

On Sunday morning, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) didn’t specify what kind of aid package the House would consider — whether the combined Senate package or a stand-alone Israel bill. He instead simply noted that Republicans are “going to try again this week” to pass some sort of aid package for Israel.

“The details of that package are being put together right now,” Johnson said on “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News. “We’re looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.”

House Democrats have said they would quickly help the speaker pass the Senate-approved supplemental package, but Johnson has been unequivocal against the House considering the Senate bill without also addressing border security and adding conditions on how Ukraine is funded — two issues that have greatly divided the GOP conference.

The uncertainty of how to address Ukraine funding — and the threat by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) to oust Johnson from the speakership if he holds such a vote — is why Republicans began pushing for a stand-alone Israel bill. On Sunday, Johnson noted that one of his first acts as speaker was to pass an Israel funding bill with “offsets” including cuts to the IRS that a majority of House Republicans supported. Because of this provision, however, the Senate refused to take that bill up.

In a post rife with inflammatory language, Greene said there “should be separate bills.” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) echoed Greene, indicating the trouble Johnson could face if he tries to pass a supplemental package through the House Rules Committee that Massie and two far-right members sit on.

Johnson tried to pass a straightforward Israel bill several months ago under suspension because the far-right members of his party opposed the lack of IRS cuts, but that effort failed to garner enough Democratic support because the bill did not include humanitarian aid. Democrats also did not want to lose leverage by passing an Israel-only bill and to not have another mechanism to secure Ukraine funding.

National security Republicans, who will speak with Johnson late Sunday to brainstorm a path forward, broke with a majority of their colleagues by urging passage of bills aiding foreign allies facing immediate threats.

“I think it will have overwhelming support — both the Ukraine, Israel and Asia packages — not just because of what’s happened with Iran escalating the conflict in the Middle East, but because these are allies that need and deserve our support,” House Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio) said.

The House and Senate are in session for one more week before their next scheduled break from Washington, adding urgency to address the matter swiftly. Over the weekend, House Republicans appeared to be aware that time is running short.

In the wake of news of the attack, members of the Republican Study Committee, the largest faction of the five GOP ideological “families,” huddled during a previously scheduled retreat Saturday night to discuss the developments and how they could urgently address the matter. They agreed that the House must act immediately upon arriving back in Washington this week to pass a stand-alone Israel funding bill. That message was relayed to Johnson, who, according to multiple people familiar with the meeting and conversations, was described as being in listening mode as he received feedback from all corners of the conference.

By Saturday evening, Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) said on X that the House would change its legislative schedule for the week to prioritize considering “legislation that supports our ally Israel and holds Iran and its terrorist proxies accountable,” but added that “details on the legislative items to be considered will be forthcoming.”

And Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), head of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CBS News’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday that he and the chairs of other national security-adjacent committees in the House will meet with Johnson on Sunday evening to draft out a course of action for the week. But his goals for the aid package diverge deeply from some of the hard-line members of the GOP.

McCaul remained adamant that the House must fund Ukraine’s war effort alongside Israel’s.

“What happened in Israel last night happens in Ukraine every night,” McCaul said.

Securing aid to Israel but punting on Ukraine would still mark a victory for Iran, a staunch ally of Russia that has supplied many of the drones Moscow is launching on Ukraine, McCaul said. Moreover, sending aid to Taiwan is imperative to counter China’s encroachment on the nearby democracy. The fight against one is the fight against the other, he argued.

“Would I need to educate my colleagues that they’re all tied together?” McCaul said. “I mean, Iran is selling this stuff to Russia. Guess who’s buying Iran’s energy? China.”

He added that Republicans can’t just say “Iran is bad, but Russia’s okay and China is bad.”

“We can’t do that — they’re all in this together,” he said.

Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), who has long opposed further aid for Ukraine, argued in a Sunday morning interview with CNN that the United States can’t “possibly support Ukraine and Israel and our own defense needs” in the way Democrats and some House Republicans demand.

“Israel’s a much closer ally, is a much more core American national security interest,” he said. “If we pass the Ukraine and Israel supplemental and send a ton of weapons to Ukraine that the Israelis need, we’re actually weakening Israel in the name of helping them.”

But the $95 billion supplemental bill is not mutually exclusive — it includes funding for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. The measure would provide about $60 billion in additional aid to Ukraine, much of which would come in the form of weapons; about $14 billion for Israel; $9 billion in humanitarian assistance to Gaza; and $5 billion to aid the Indo-Pacific.

House Democrats and senators from both parties have been urging the House take up the Senate proposal since its passage two months ago. Even before Iran’s attack on Israel, House Democrats publicly and a contingency of House Republicans privately have been saying that there is no way Johnson can strike an agreement that appeases a fractious GOP conference on such contentious issues, let alone in one week.

Early Sunday morning, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said that the Senate-approved supplemental package should pass on Monday.

“The world is on fire. We should stand with our Democratic allies and push back against the enemies of freedom,” he posted on X. “The House must pass the bipartisan national security bill. Tomorrow.”

Even Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) — who has vowed to continue supporting Ukraine, earning him the moniker “Republican in Name Only” from Trump and other far-right Republicans — has signaled to Johnson that he should ignore the right-wing opposition within his conference and move ahead with the Senate-approval package.

“The national security supplemental that has waited months for action will provide critical resources to Israel and our own military forces in the region. It will provide overdue lethal assistance to Ukraine and equip vulnerable allies and partners in Asia,” McConnell said in a statement Saturday. “The Commander-in-Chief and the Congress must discharge our fundamental duties without delay. The consequences of failure are clear, devastating, and avoidable.”

On Sunday afternoon, President Biden convened a call with Johnson, McConnell, Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to discuss the Iran attack and aid options for Israel.

Schumer said in news conference after that call that he urged Johnson to move forward with the Senate supplemental.

“The best way to help Israel and to help Ukraine is to pass the supplemental this week,” Schumer said. “There was a consensus on the phone among all the leaders that we had to help Israel and help Ukraine, and now hopefully we can work that out and get this done next week. It’s vital for the future of Ukraine, for Israel and the West.”

House Democrats are largely united in their effort to pass the Senate package, launching a discharge petition last month that would override GOP leadership’s unwillingness to consider the legislation by forcing a vote on the measure if 218 lawmakers sign on.

According to multiple Democrats familiar with the discussions, Democratic leadership aims to get at least 200 to sign on since some in the far-left faction will not back it in opposition to funding Israel. Former speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has personally taken the initiative to whip more support, getting four more Democrats — including three liberals — to reach 195 signatures.

Some Republicans have privately said they would sign onto the Democratic petition, as well as a bipartisan one that also includes border security measures, if far-right Republicans block the conference from backing whatever Johnson proposes.

Yet if Johnson moves on the Senate bill and Greene triggers the process to oust him from the speakership, Jeffries said at a Thursday news conference “that there are a reasonable number of Democrats who would not want to see the speaker fall as a result of doing the right thing.”","A lawyer who represented OJ Simpson said there were no plans to donate the former NFL player’s brain to science and that his body would be cremated.

Simpson, who became the subject of an intense national debate in America after he was accused – and cleared – of the 1994 murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, died last week aged 76. He was later found liable for the two killings in a civil case.

Rumors circulated in recent days that Simpson’s brain would be used to study CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease sometimes diagnosed in former NFL players and believed to be a result of repeated collisions on the field.

Lawyer Malcolm LaVergne, now serving as the executor of Simpson’s estate, told NBC News that donating Simpson’s brain to CTE study was a “hard no”, adding: “His entire body, including his brain, will be cremated.”

LaVergne said there are tentative plans for a “celebration of life” limited to close friends and family, including his five children.

LaVergne also clarified comments he made to the Las Vegas Review-Journal in which he said he wanted the family of Ron Goldman to “get zero, nothing” from Simpson’s estate relating to a $33m civil judgment in 1997 that Simpson had “willingly and wrongfully” caused Goldman and Brown’s deaths.

LaVergne said he had been referring to a debt collector working for the Goldman family who, he said, “within an hour we announced Simpson’s death, is bashing Simpson and all this stuff … ‘We’re going to do this and that.’”

He acknowledged that his comment had been “pretty harsh”, and that as executor and representative of the Simpson family “it’s time to tone down the rhetoric”.

But LaVergne warned that Simpson owed money to the IRS and that many of his possessions, including footballs, jerseys and other sports memorabilia, had long ago been seized toward the 1997 judgement.","The entire ordeal was seeped in paradox: A literal All-American, a so-called raceless football legend and the star of ubiquitous television commercials was at the center of a story of violence and villainy that unearthed deeply rooted and fragile racial fault lines between Black and white Americans. The erstwhile hero who, unlike more activist Black athletes of his era, had chosen to avoid tough questions about American racism in exchange for “safe Negro” status, fame and endorsements. That avoidance had plagued him for much of his career and ascension, and separated him from many of his contemporaries like Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Jim Brown in the eyes of many Black Americans. And in one fell swoop, he was now on the run after the brutal double murder of his white ex-wife and her white friend.

A so-called raceless football legend and the star of commercials was at the center of a story of violence that unearthed racial fault lines between Black and white Americans.

We had never seen anything like the 1994 murders of Nicole Brown-Simpson and Ron Goldman that led to O.J. Simpson being tried the next year. Likewise, we had never witnessed anything that resembled the contrasts of jubilation and anger that erupted (almost exclusively along racial lines) when the Los Angeles jury quickly returned “not guilty” verdicts in October 1995. For many Black Americans, there was a confusion born out of irony: How could white people pay such close attention to this trial, but on the issue of racial dynamics, completely miss the bus? Even now, there are many who remain puzzled that O.J. Simpson was acquitted. The answer is as straightforward as it is unpleasant: White supremacy led to O.J.’s acquittal.

To understand this, you have to know the context, which is the justified distrust Black communities had for the Los Angeles Police Department and the larger criminal justice system. It was simultaneously an unprecedented time of gang violence and a high influx of drugs, and a time when police accused of abuse seemed to evade accountability and when even nonpolice who victimized Black people seemed to get off, too.


Take the case in March 1991 when Korean shop owner Soon Ja Du fatally shot Latasha Harlins, a 15-year-old Black girl, in the back of the head after she’d wrongly accused her of stealing a bottle of orange juice. A jury convicted the shop owner of voluntary manslaughter, but a Los Angeles judge sentenced Du only to probation. Du killed Harlins within two weeks of Los Angeles police beating Rodney King.

It’s not hyperbole to say that the heat from embers from the 1992 Los Angeles riots, sparked by the acquittal of the four officers who beat King on almost all charges, could still be felt in the air in 1994 and 1995 when members of the Los Angeles Police Department investigated Simpson and testified during his trial. Black Angelenos (and Black people across the nation) believed the LAPD to be the racist enforcement arm of a bigger system that was not only unjust, but went out of its way to target Black people.

Republicans can’t stand the idea of Biden closing the ‘gun show loophole’

And then the prosecution put LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman on the stand.

Fuhrman was the wrecking ball who destroyed the prosecution’s case and helped lead so many Black people outside the courtroom to root against the state.

Through my lens as a former prosecutor and as a civil rights lawyer, it’s easy for me to see that Fuhrman was the wrecking ball who destroyed the prosecution’s case and helped lead so many Black people outside the courtroom to root against the state. The defense playing audio evidence for the jury that Fuhrman had used an anti-Black racial slur (after he’d denied ever having done so), and the public outside the courtroom learning that he’d invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked if he’d ever planted evidence, to many validated (and, in some respects, vindicated) the Angelenos whose warnings about the LAPD had been ignored.

The Fuhrman tape and the portrait the defense painted of Fuhrman was the prompt to root against the system, even if there was a suspicion that O.J. may have done it and we, in turn, were rooting for a cold-blooded killer. As the public discourse grew, Black people sensed that part of what had drawn white America’s ire was a sense of betrayal. Not simply because of a violent act that claimed the lives of two people, but a much deeper betrayal that came from O.J. having been accepted and ordained as “special” or “different” and that, in their minds, these allegations proved to them that they were wrong about him all along. This dynamic resulted in a peculiar impact: White people who once embraced him were acting as if O.J. had committed a crime not only against the two victims but against white people at large; for Black Americans who observed this, that notion combined with some white people acting as if the evidence of racism didn’t matter, made many of the facts matter less.

Though the impetus for the trial was the murder of two innocent people, the racial overtones of the case began to make O.J. a symbol, even among Black people whom he had not previously tried to ingratiate himself with. The more White America unabashedly attempted to demonize O.J., the more he garnered support from Black America. Rightly or wrongly, those Black people saw in O.J. the faceless victims whose stories would never be heard and who had gotten a raw deal from police and the justice system. Many saw him as taking on the system of white supremacy. They were rooting for a “loss” by an oppressive power structure, not so much a “win” for O.J. as an individual.

And, in that way, the paradox became complete. Not only had an All-American, purportedly raceless hero been turned into a Black supervillain, but the very audience he’d turned away from to better appeal to white Americans ended up being the people who chose to protect him when he turned back to them in crisis.

What would have happened if the LAPD hadn’t fomented such distrust in the Black community?

How might things have played out without the heavy hand of white supremacy putting its thumb on the scale? That is, what would have happened if the LAPD hadn’t fomented such distrust in the Black community? What would have happened if the prosecution didn’t have to use the testimony of a person with Fuhrman’s history? What if Fuhrman’s involvement had not raised legitimate concerns as to the handling of the investigation that ultimately planted the seeds of reasonable doubt? What would have happened if his white fans didn’t see O.J. as Black until he was accused of a brutally violent crime? We can never know for sure. But we do know that those expressions of white supremacy are a big reason why Orenthal James Simpson walked free.","Donald Trump on Monday became the first former president ever to stand trial for alleged criminal wrongdoing -- a historic moment that raises key questions for his 2024 campaign for the White House.

Trump denies wrongdoing in the case, out of New York, which centers around hush money paid to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential bid, in order to stop Daniels from going public about what she claimed was an affair with him, which he denies.

According to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Trump allegedly engaged in a scheme with his then-lawyer Michael Cohen and others to influence the 2016 election by suppressing negative information about him. Trump is accused of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.

The case is one of four indictments that Trump faces and is the first to go to trial, putting his legal problems directly before jurors -- and the public.

He has pleaded not guilty in each case and has maintained his competitiveness in the general election: Early national polls show him narrowly ahead or narrowly behind his successor, President Joe Biden.

But the trial could create major political consequences for Trump. Here are five key campaign questions as he heads to court.

How much would a conviction sway voters?
Strategists on both sides of the aisle have forecast that Trump's current legal limbo -- charged but not yet on trial, repeatedly denying the evidence and accusations laid out against him by prosecutors -- won't, on its own, doom his chances of winning back the White House.

Polling appears to bear that out. For example, a New York Times/Siena College survey released on Saturday found that 54% of registered voters said they believed Trump had committed ""serious federal crimes,"" but only 26% said they were paying a lot of attention to the former president's legal struggles.

And while 46% of registered voters in the poll said Trump should be convicted in the New York case, Trump still held a 1-point lead over Biden overall in the survey, 46-45%.

But polls have also indicated that a conviction could be a game-changer for the former president.

A late-January NBC News national poll of registered voters found that Trump led Biden 47-42% -- but that Biden would have a 45-43% edge if Trump were to be found guilty and convicted of a felony this year.

And a poll from Reuters/Ipsos published on Wednesday found that 60% of registered voters said they would not vote for Trump if he were to be convicted of a felony by a jury.

Even if the dropoff in Trump's support after a hypothetical conviction isn't huge, this year's race is anticipated to be decided based on just tens or hundreds of thousands of votes across a handful of swing states, as in 2016 and 2020, leaving neither candidate with much margin for error.

How will Trump campaign from court?
While his criminal trial in New York will complicate his ability to be in front of voters as a candidate, he's expected to use the courthouse as another stop on the trail.

Trump himself will need to be in court for the entire trial, which will be held every weekday except on Wednesdays, forcing him to balance his time there and on the trail for up to eight weeks, approximately.

""We'll just have to figure it out,"" he said in February. ""I'll be here during the day, and I'll be campaigning during the night.""

But the trial will also fix the national news media's attention on the historic proceedings, even as the proceedings themselves won't be broadcast because TV cameras aren't allowed in court.

While attending previous court hearings related to his legal troubles, Trump used that attention to give campaign-like speeches before the cameras -- which he could continue to do essentially as much as he wants (though he remains bound by a gag order that limits some of what he can say related to people connected to the New York trial).

He's also expected to hold events on the same days as his court appearances, his campaign insists, and he will still be free on Wednesdays and weekends, allowing him to hold his favored rallies.

He spoke briefly with reporters before entering court on Monday morning, claiming persecution and saying, ""There is no case.""

""Not only will we take full advantage of off days on Wednesdays and the weekends, President Trump will be driving his message with both in-person and virtual events on court days,"" campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said.

However, other Trump sources disputed this.

Sources close to his legal team have said his lawyers will try and convince him not to hold his standard hallway gaggles and press conferences after court given fears over repeated gag order violations and given that he's not allowed to utter a word about prospective jurors -- though sources said the situation is fluid and they are prepared for anything.

Trump is technically already ""on notice"" from Judge Juan Merchan about violating the gag order related to jury selection, which Merchan wrote in an order earlier this month could lead to Trump losing the ""statutory right he might have to access juror names if he engages in conduct that threatens the safety and integrity of the jury or the jury selection process.""

But campaign advisers, keenly aware of just how close this election could be, say they are quietly hoping the former president takes the opportunity to speak to the cameras to reinforce their narrative.

""Voters see that President Trump is the strongest candidate to lead our country and nobody fights back harder than he does,"" Leavitt said in her statement, in part. ""President Trump will continue to fight for truth in the courtroom and to share his winning message on the campaign trail.""

What remains less clear is whether or not the trial will consume Trump's message on the trail -- or whether he'll balance it with other issues like high inflation and immigration, conflict in the Middle East and more.

How does Trump message the case to voters?
Up until now, Trump has been repeating his claims that his legal struggles are the result of political persecution by prosecutors including Bragg, a Democrat.

The former president recently ramped up his rhetoric of victimhood, hyperbolically linking himself to the struggles of famed South African leader Nelson Mandela against apartheid and sharing a supporter's comparison of his legal troubles to how Jesus Christ was martyred by the Romans.

But prosecutors have uniformly rejected allegations of partisanship as baseless, pointing to the evidence in the indictments, which were approved by grand juries.

Responding to the case in New York, Trump has lashed out at the character of Daniels and Cohen, his former attorney-turned-critic, calling both of them ""liars."" He has previously defended the $130,000 he paid Daniels, with his attorneys describing it as extortion.

Does Biden say anything?
Biden has largely refrained from seizing on the particulars of any of the cases against Trump, seeking to maintain distance between the campaign and the decisions of prosecutors who say politics plays no role in their work.

That is not expected to change with the New York trial, as neither the Democratic National Committee nor the Biden campaign intends to comment on it.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre previously said Biden isn't paying attention to Trump's New York case.

""The president is going to focus on the American people like he does every day. This is not something that is a focus for him,"" she said in April 2023.

Instead, Biden is set to continue to stress a split screen with his rival, hitting the trail -- where he has emphasized issues like domestic investments, economic growth, health care and abortion while attacking Trump on abortion bans, the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol and more.

Political observers say the new stage of Trump's legal struggles presents Biden with something of a conundrum, though.

Weighing in on the case risks feeding Trump's argument that the cases are politically motivated. Avoiding it, however, robs Biden of the opportunity to discuss the news of the day, which is likely to flood headlines related to the election, while he tries to convince voters he deserves a second term.

How much do the scandalous details stick?
Experts and strategists who spoke with ABC News said the underlying facts of the case -- the payments to Daniels to cover up an alleged affair -- haven't been a breaking point for the electorate, which they attributed to Trump's long history of controversies about his personal life.

Trump also denies the two ever had a relationship.

But District Attorney Bragg will now have the chance to prosecute Trump and present his evidence before the public. Prosecutors are expected to take several weeks to do so, which could directly undermine Trump's denials and the contention that Bragg's case is baseless. It's less clear how long Trump's defense will take to rebut the prosecution's case in court.

Daniels -- who claims her affair with Trump took place in 2006 shortly after the birth of Trump's son Barron with wife Melania Trump -- is herself a potential witness.

With details of the alleged affair and cover-up set to be back in the spotlight, feeding constant news coverage, it raises the question of whether that will stick in voters' minds.

Past politicians from Gary Hart to John Edwards to Mark Sanford to Anthony Weiner -- and more -- have all seen their future political careers upended by allegations of sexual misconduct or extramarital affairs.

In Trump's case, however, Daniels' affair claim has not been confirmed.

More broadly, through his decades as a brash, braggadocious real estate mogul and reality TV star at home in the tabloids, he built a public image resistant to such allegations -- and he maintains his good standing with the GOP base.

He was also narrowly elected president in 2016 shortly after the release of a 2005 tape from behind the scenes of ""Access Hollywood"" in which he boasted about grabbing and kissing women without consent, which he defended as ""locker room banter.""

More recently, he was found liable in a civil case for sexually assaulting and defaming former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll after she sued him. He continues to deny her account and is appealing.

At the crux of the case, known as Fischer v. U.S., is whether federal prosecutors can apply a law passed in the wake of the Enron scandal, which makes it a crime to ""corruptly"" obstruct or impede an official proceeding, to the Jan. 6 assault.

Before the Jan. 6 attack, prosecutors had never used the law in cases that did not involve evidence tampering, as the first provision of the measure prohibits altering, destroying, mutilating or concealing a document. But since Jan. 6, it has been levied against more than 330 defendants who breached the building where Congress had convened a joint session to tally states' electoral votes.

It is also being used to prosecute Trump, who pleaded not guilty to one count of obstructing Congress' counting of Electoral College votes, one count of conspiring to obstruct the proceeding and two others brought against him by special counsel Jack Smith in Washington, D.C., last year.

The outcome of the legal fight is being closely watched because of the possible ramifications for the charges against Trump, which stem from what Smith alleges was a multi-pronged scheme to overturn the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. If the court sides with Fischer, Trump could seek to have the two counts related to obstruction of an official proceeding dismissed.

Trump's case has been paused for months as he seeks to have the charges dismissed on the grounds he is entitled to presidential immunity. The Supreme Court will consider that issue next week.

Separate from Trump, the obstruction dispute could also have repercussions for scores of Jan. 6 defendants who have already been convicted of the offense or pleaded guilty. A decision finding prosecutors stretched the obstruction law too far could prompt bids for new trials or lighter sentences.

One of those defendants, Joseph Fischer, brought the dispute currently before the Supreme Court after he was charged in a seven-count indictment in early 2021. Fischer, then a police officer in Pennsylvania, entered the Capitol around 3:25 p.m. Prosecutors claimed he encouraged rioters to ""charge"" and ran into a line of officers while yelling an obscenity.

His lawyers, though, said Fischer was pushed by the crowd into a police line. Fischer was in the Capitol for less than four minutes, they told the court.

Among the charges Fischer faced was assaulting a police officer, disorderly conduct and corruptly obstructing, influencing and impeding an official proceeding — Congress' certification of the Electoral College vote. The charge was enacted as part of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and violators face up to 20 years in prison.

Fischer moved to dismiss the count. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols granted his request, determining that nothing in the indictment alleged that Fischer ""took some action with respect to a document, record, or other object"" in order to obstruct the congressional proceedings.

The Justice Department appealed Nichols' ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which ruled against Fischer in a divided decision last year.

In the lead opinion, Judge Florence Pan acknowledged that outside of the Jan. 6 cases, there was no precedent for using the obstruction statute to prosecute conduct like Fischer's. Still, she concluded that the district court was wrong to adopt a narrow interpretation of the law that limited its application to obstructive conduct involving a document or record.

Pan noted that 14 of 15 district judges in D.C. adopted a broader reading of the statute and called the near-unanimity ""striking.""

Key to the ruling was the interpretation of the word ""otherwise,"" which Pan wrote meant that the second of the provision's two sections applies to ""all forms of corrupt obstruction of an official proceeding,"" outside of what is covered by the first section.

Lawyers for Fischer asked the Supreme Court to review the D.C. Circuit's decision, and it agreed to do so in December.

In filings with the high court, defense attorneys urged the justices to narrow the scope of the law, arguing it targets ""discrete acts intended to affect the availability of evidence"" used in an official proceeding. 

Congress, they said, intended to protect the integrity of investigations and evidence when lawmakers wrote the measure after the Enron scandal. The company's outsider auditor, Arthur Andersen, was shown to have destroyed incriminating documents.

Defense attorneys warned that without limiting the reach of the obstruction law, its scope is ""breathtaking"" and unconstitutional. 

""Anything that affects or hinders a proceeding falls within the government's definition,"" they wrote. ""But that definition encompasses lobbying, advocacy, and protest, the very mechanisms that citizens employ to influence government.""

Michael Heiskell, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, agreed that prosecutors' application of the statute is too broad, and warned it can lead to overcriminalization.

""This is one of these examples where you can have an overzealous prosecutor and apply it to certain situations that it shouldn't be applied to,"" he told CBS News.

Heiskell echoed Fischer's concerns that if the Supreme Court sides with the Justice Department, prosecutors could stretch the statute to cover acts like lobbying.

""It's so vague and general and subject to different interpretations that we oppose its use in this instance for the Jan. 6 people, especially those who went in, may have broken some laws with trespassing, but then to leapfrog and say these folks try to corruptly influence an official proceeding? That's just too vague,"" he said.

The Justice Department, though, said the text, context and history of the provision shows it broadly bars a person from corruptly engaging in conduct to obstruct court, agency and congressional proceedings.

Accepting Fischer's argument, wrote Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar in a Supreme Court brief, ""would undermine Congress's effort to prohibit unanticipated methods of corruptly obstructing an official proceeding — such as petitioner's alleged conduct in joining a violent riot to disrupt the joint session of Congress certifying the presidential election results.""

Prelogar refuted warnings from Fischer's attorneys that if interpreted broadly, the law would be used to prosecute constitutionally protected conduct like lobbying or peaceful protests. Instead, she said the statute is limited to acts that hinder a proceeding, and advocacy like lobbying or presenting oral argument before a court don't qualify.

""The text of the provision resolves this case, and there is no basis to insert language into the statute that Congress did not write,"" she argued, noting that it functions as a ""catchall offense"" designed to cover all forms of corrupt obstruction of an official proceeding.

Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., called fears about how the obstruction statute may be used in the future ""baseless,"" since prosecutors apply it only in cases where they can show corrupt intent.

""We haven't seen prosecutions of innocent lobbyists, so why would that change in the future just because we applied this statute to an unprecedented event?"" he asked, noting that the offense has been on the books for 20 years. ""Unprecedented crimes lead to unprecedented prosecutions.""

He questioned how the law could be read ambiguously.

""Someone who participates in a riot, shuts down a proceeding, forces members to flee, is obstructing that proceeding,"" Eliason said. ""The statute applies. Period.""

Ramifications of a decision

The Supreme Court said in December it would take up the case, and its decision to do so reverberated swiftly. Some defendants who were convicted of violating the obstruction statute but not yet sentenced sought to pause their proceedings until the justices rule, likely by the end of June.

If the court sides with Fischer and finds the law narrowly covers corrupt evidence-related conduct, there could be dozens of defendants who have been convicted and seek resentencing, withdraw guilty pleas or ask for a new trial, said Eliason, who now teaches criminal law at George Washington University.

""It may not result in a lot of people being released from prison, but it will result in a lot of court proceedings where judges have to deal with it,"" he said.

One of those defendants is Donovan Crowl, a member of the Oath Keepers who was convicted last year of conspiracy to obstruct Congress' counting of electoral votes and set to be sentenced in January. But Crowl's lawyer, Carmen Hernandez, recently renewed a request to halt his sentencing pending the Supreme Court's resolution of the Fischer case.

Federal prosecutors opposed an earlier bid by Hernandez to delay the sentencing but changed their position in response to her request last month.

""I do believe the statute was never intended to reach this conduct. It was a statute enacted to reach corporate fraud,"" Hernandez told CBS News, adding that ""in 20 years on the books, it has never been used against any demonstrators.""

Hernandez said she is hopeful the Supreme Court will side with Fischer and the decision will favorably impact her client.

As for the impact on Trump's case, Eliason said he believes the obstruction-related counts against Trump will withstand any Supreme Court decision, in part because his alleged conduct may constitute evidence-based obstruction.

The special counsel has accused Trump of deceitfully organizing fake slates of electors in seven battleground states and urging state officials to send the false certificates to Congress.

""You can frame that as tampering with physical evidence in the proceeding, submitting false evidence,"" Eliason said. ""Even if the court agrees with Fischer, the Trump charges can survive. But it'll cause a real mess for the other Jan. 6 defendants.""

Smith told the Supreme Court in a filing in the immunity case last week that regardless of which side prevails, the charges against Trump are still valid.

Pointing to Trump's alleged efforts to use fake slates of electors during the joint session of Congress held on Jan. 6, the special counsel wrote the creation of the phony documents ""satisfies an evidence-impairment interpretation.""

Kamala Harris blames Trump for abortion bans during Arizona visit","WASHINGTON − Former President Donald Trump highlighted concerns from America's Founding Fathers about hyper-partisanship to argue in a filing with the Supreme Court on Monday that he shouldn't be prosecuted for trying to overturn the 2020 election.

In Trump's final brief laying out his case before the Supreme Court hears oral arguments on April 25, his lawyers cited writings from George Washington and James Madison to bolster his case that opening the door to presidential prosecutions would invite political abuse.

Washington, in his farewell address, warned against the ""alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities.”

Former President Donald Trump returns to the courtroom after a break during the start of jury selection for his trial at Manhattan Criminal Court on April 15, 2024 in New York City.
Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith has dismissed such concerns, telling the court presidents can function effectively without criminal immunity, something that neither the framers of the Constitution nor any other president contemplated.

“To the contrary, a bedrock principle of our constitutional order is that no person is above the law— including the President,” Smith wrote in his brief previewing the oral arguments that was filed last week. “Nothing in constitutional text, history, precedent, or policy considerations supports the absolute immunity that petitioner seeks.”

Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president, wants the Supreme Court to dismiss his indictment on federal charges he tried to steal the 2020 election, arguing criminal prosecution presents a “mortal threat” to the independence of the presidency.

Three of those nine justices were appointed by Trump when he was president, giving the Court a conservative supermajority comprised of six people appointed by Republicans.

Even if Trump loses his appeal, the Supreme Court may not reach a decision quickly enough for a trial to proceed in time for a verdict before the November election.

Trump has pleaded not guilty to four federal charges in the case before the Supreme Court − three for conspiracy and one for obstruction − for falsely claiming election fraud and trying to overturn the legitimate election results.

Trump has repeatedly claimed that the charges are politically motivated. If he returns to the White House, he could appoint an attorney general who would seek to dismiss any pending federal charges. Trump could also simply pardon himself, although his power to do so is debated.

But Trump’s preferred outcome is for the Supreme Court to entirely dismiss the indictment, an outcome experts say is unlikely.

While former presidents have broad immunity from civil lawsuits for official actions taken while serving in the White House, Trump has attempted to claim sweeping immunity from criminal prosecution.","New York prosecutors asked a judge at the start of Donald Trump's New York criminal trial Monday to fine him and remind him he could go to jail for violating a gag order that bars him from interfering with potential witnesses.

Justice Juan Merchan set April 24 for a hearing on the request for fines and gave Trump's lawyers until this Friday to submit a written response.

The trial, the first of a former U.S. president, stems from a 2016 hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. With Trump seated at the defense table, prosecutors cited his years of criticism of witnesses, court officials and others.

Prosecutors asked the judge to fine Trump $1,000 each for each of three social-media posts this month about Daniels and Trump's former fixer and lawyer Michael Cohen.

“The defendant has demonstrated his willingness to flout the order. He has attacked witnesses in the case, in the past he has attacked grand jurors in the case,” prosecutor Christopher Conroy said.

Under Merchan's gag order, Trump is barred from making public statements about witnesses concerning their potential testimony and about prosecutors, court staff and their family members if the statements are meant to interfere with the case.

Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said Trump did not violate the gag order because he was responding to witnesses' public statements. “The two witnesses themselves have been talking about their testimony in this case, President Trump’s ongoing reelection, and just generally disparaging President Trump constantly,” Blanche said.

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, charged Trump with falsifying records to cover up a $130,000 payment in the waning days of the 2016 presidential campaign to buy the silence of Daniels about a 2006 sexual encounter she has said they had.

Trump has denied any such relationship and has pleaded not guilty.

Falsifying business records in New York is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison, though many of those found guilty have been sentenced to fines or probation.

If convicted, Trump could still hold office if he defeats Democrat President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election. But according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, half of independent voters and one in four Republicans say they would not vote for him if he were convicted of a felony.

Cohen has testified that he made the payments to buy Daniels' silence ahead of the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to violating campaign finance law, though the federal prosecutors who brought that case did not charge Trump.

Trump has called Cohen a ""serial liar"" and his lawyers are expected to attack his credibility at trial.

Trump, 77, is required to attend the trial, which is expected to last through May. Merchan warned him that he could be sent to jail if he disrupted the proceedings, adding that he gives that warning to all defendants at the outset of a trial.

The selection of 12 jurors and six alternates from a pool of Manhattan residents is expected to take about a week, followed by witness testimony.

Wearing his signature blue suit and red tie, Trump watched while Merchan set limits on witnesses and evidence to be presented at trial and denied a motion by Trump's lawyers to have the judge recuse himself.

The judge said some 500 potential jurors were waiting while legal arguments took place.

Police stood guard in front of the courthouse amid a maze of barricades. A handful of protesters carried hand-painted signs reading “LOSER” and “convict Trump already.”

Though the case is regarded by some legal experts as the least consequential of the four criminal prosecutions he faces, it is the only one guaranteed to go to trial before the Nov. 5 election.

The businessman-turned-politician, who served as president from 2017 to 2021, says he is being targeted by his political enemies.

""This is political persecution,"" Trump said before entering the courtroom.

In his three other criminal cases, Trump stands accused of mishandling classified information and trying to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. He has pleaded not guilty in all of those cases.

Bragg has argued that the case concerns an unlawful scheme to corrupt the 2016 election by burying a scandalous story that would have harmed Trump's campaign. Trump's lawyers have said the payment did not amount to an illegal campaign contribution.

Choosing a jury from a pool of people from heavily Democrat Manhattan could take several days, to be followed by opening statements and testimony from a parade of potentially riveting witnesses, including Cohen and Daniels.

David Pecker, the former head of the National Enquirer tabloid, will also testify that he ran stories in the tabloid to boost Trump's 2016 campaign, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said.

Also due on the witness stand is Karen McDougal, a former nude model for Playboy magazine who prosecutors say was paid by the National Enquirer to keep quiet about an affair she says she had with Trump.

Merchan said he would not permit witnesses or prosecutors to tell the jury that the affair took place while Trump's wife Melania was pregnant with their child.

Trump has said he plans to testify in his own defense, a move that could open him to cross-examination."
"As things stand now, 48 states are set to allocate their electors this November according to the winner of the popular vote in their state. Whoever gets the most votes — no matter the margin — gets all the electors.

In the remaining two states, Maine and Nebraska, the process works a little differently. There, electoral votes are partly divvied up on a proportional basis. In Nebraska, two of its five electoral votes are given to the winner of the statewide popular vote, and the other three are given to the victor in each of the state’s three congressional districts. In Maine, two of the state’s four electoral votes go to the winner of the popular vote, and the other two are split between its two congressional districts.

In the 2020 presidential election, for only the second time since it adopted this system in 1991, Nebraska split its electoral votes between the two candidates on the ballot. Donald Trump won the state and its First and Third Congressional Districts, and Joe Biden won the Second Congressional District, representing parts of Omaha and surrounding areas.

Biden won that election with 306 electoral votes; the Nebraska elector did not make a difference. But in an exceedingly close election — say, an election between an unpopular incumbent and an equally unpopular challenger (himself a former incumbent) — it could. Which is why Nebraska Republicans have begun an effort, backed by Trump, to end its quasi-proportional allocation of electoral votes.

Nebraska Republicans seem to know that this move is a vigorous exercise in partisan venality, which is why they’ve tried to defend it with a time-honored appeal to the founding fathers. “It would bring Nebraska in line with 48 of our fellow states, better reflect the founders’ intent and ensure our state speaks with one unified voice in presidential elections,” Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, wrote in a statement. (Trump called it “a very smart letter.”)

It is well within the rights of the Nebraska Legislature to adopt the winner-take-all system that most other states use to allocate electors. But I am less interested in the substance of the change than I am in the justification for the decision. That is the common, even ubiquitous, idea that the current form of the Electoral College represents the original intent of the drafters and ratifiers of the Constitution. The problem is simple: It’s not true.

Any attempt to impute an original intent to the framers’ construction of the Electoral College runs into the basic problem that it was, even compared with everything else in the Constitution, a last-minute and hastily constructed compromise meant to get around a large set of almost intractable differences.

Delegates to the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 were consumed with argument over the method and mode of presidential selection. In the first vote taken on the issue, early in the convention, most delegates favored legislative selection. But several of the most influential delegates, among them James Madison of Virginia, thought that this threatened the separation of powers and thus the basic structure of the new government.

Madison observed in his notes that it was “a fundamental principle of free government that the legislative, executive and judiciary powers should be separately … and independently exercised.” As such, it was “essential, then, that the appointment of the executive should either be drawn from some source or held by some tenure that will give him a free agency with regard to the legislature.”

Madison and his like-minded allies — the Pennsylvanians James Wilson and Gouverneur Morris, for example — favored a national popular vote to choose the president. Direct election by “the people” (for the most part, property-owning white men) would guarantee executive independence and filter for men of “distinguished character or services.” On the other side were Southern delegates who thought a popular vote would put them on the losing side of presidential contests; the free population of the North was, of course, larger than the free population of the South. Still other delegates wanted the legislative option to prevail.

In “Why Do We Still Have the Electoral College?” the historian Alexander Keyssar writes that more than a few other ideas bubbled up over the course of that summer. Among them:

selection by the governors of the states or by state legislatures; election by a committee of 15 legislators chosen by lot (and obliged to act as soon as they were chosen, to avoid intrigue); a popular election in which each voter cast ballots for two or three candidates, only one of whom could be from his own state: nomination of one candidate by the people of each state, with the winner to then be chosen by the national legislature.

As the convention came to a close, the exhausted delegates finally made a choice: Someone else would have to choose. They turned the issue over to a committee on “postponed parts.” That committee, in turn, tried to chart a path of least resistance through the options at hand. First, it adopted an idea — introduced during the summer of discussion — to have electors act as intermediaries between the public and the selection of the president. In a concession to supporters of legislative selection, those electors would gather in a purpose-made body to make their decision. In a nod to the concerns of Southern delegates, the distribution of electors would be based on representation in the House and Senate.

The committee made its recommendation, and with one major modification — the House of Representatives, not the Senate, would decide in the event that no candidate earned a majority — the convention accepted it. The delegates had no real sense of how the Electoral College would work in practice. More than a few thought that most elections would be decided by the House. And in any case, they also knew that however the people chose a president, their first choice would be George Washington. To both the framers and the ratifiers, the mechanism was less important than the man.

In the first presidential elections of the American republic, the Electoral College worked mostly as designed. Some states held popular elections to choose electors; others had them selected by state legislatures. Electors cast their ballots for the man who would be president, Washington, and designated a candidate for vice president as well, John Adams (an effort that required some coordination, since until the ratification of the 12th Amendment, electors could not cast separate ballots for president and vice president). But with the full emergence of partisan politics during Washington’s second term and his departure at its conclusion, state legislatures, essentially acting as partisan political organizations, tried to game the system.

“States,” Keyssar notes, “took advantage of the flexible constitutional architecture to switch procedures from one election to the next.” They would move from legislative selection of electors to a district-based vote to a winner-take-all election (called the general ticket), depending on which option was more likely to secure victory for the legislature’s favored candidate. Virginia, for example, switched from district elections to winner-take-all in 1800 to help Thomas Jefferson win the presidency.

As formal political parties took shape — and center stage — in American politics, more and more state legislatures adopted winner-take-all allocation of electors, in addition to taking steps to ensure that electors would not be independent of the party that chose them. By the time of Jefferson’s battle for re-election in 1804, the framers’ Electoral College — a deliberative body that would filter candidates for selection by the House — was a dead letter. In its place was an effectively new system tailored to partisan reality.

As Keyssar writes:

Candidates for president and vice president were put forward by political parties, centered in Congress; the parties also coordinated the election campaigns. Nearly everywhere the strategic goal of these campaigns was to win legislative or popular majorities within entire states — since all but four (out of 17) delivered their full complement of electoral votes to one candidate. Those votes were physically cast by electors who gathered in state capitals and served simply as messengers: they did not deliberate, discuss or “think.”

The Electoral College as we know it is less a product of the insight or design of the framers and more a contingent adaptation to the political world that emerged out of the first decade of the American republic. That world would change again, in the 1820s and ’30s, with the rise of Andrew Jackson, universal white male suffrage and the mass political party. The electoral system would adjust; by 1837, not willing to lose any partisan advantage, every state (save South Carolina) would adopt winner-take-all allocation of electors by popular vote. The tally of popular votes took on new significance as well: It stood, for the winner, as a symbol of popular legitimacy, even if it didn’t contribute to the outcome of the election.

There is nothing in the Constitution that says Nebraska Republicans can’t change the way the state allocates its electoral voters. At most, if they made the change, Nebraska Republicans would be violating the informal rules of American politics, which strongly discourage this abuse of the process. Again, I think Nebraska Republicans know this, which explains their immediate appeal to the supposed intent of the framers. This is something Americans do. We use the framers — or more accurately, we use the myths and folk traditions we’ve developed around the framers — to legitimize our decisions in the present day and to try to delegitimize those of our opponents.

But whether as men or myths, the framers cannot do this. They cannot justify the choices we make while we navigate our world. The beauty and, perhaps, the curse of self-government is that it is, in fact, self-government. Our choices are our own, and we must defend them on their own terms. And while it is often good and useful to look to the past for guidance, the past cannot answer our questions or tackle our problems.

Novelty may disturb men’s minds, but we are still obligated to take our circumstances on their own terms, not those of an age long settled into dust.","It is the ""sleeper"" case that could upend the most closely watched criminal prosecution in the nation. And how the U.S. Supreme Court decides the fate of an obscure Capitol riot defendant will have immediate legal and political implications for the former and perhaps future president.    

The justices on Tuesday will hold oral arguments in the appeal of Joseph Fischer, one of more than 300 people charged by the Justice Department with ""obstruction of an official proceeding"" in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection in Washington.

That charge refers to the disruption of Congress’ certification of Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory over Donald Trump.

Special counsel Jack Smith has also brought an obstruction charge against Trump, which is among four counts the 2024 presumptive Republican presidential nominee faces. His trial in that case was slated to begin March 4, but the Supreme Court's decision to hear this case and a separate dispute over Trump's claim of presidential immunity has delayed proceedings indefinitely.

THE CHARGES
A federal judge earlier dismissed the obstruction offense against three Jan. 6 criminal defendants, ruling it did not cover their conduct on the Capitol grounds. Those defendants are onetime police patrolman Fischer, Garret Miller of the Dallas area and Edward Jacob Lang of New York’s Hudson Valley.

Fischer's appeal was the one the high court accepted for final review.

U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a 2019 Trump bench appointee, determined prosecutors stretched the law beyond its scope to inappropriately apply it in these cases, ruling a defendant must have taken ""some action with respect to a document, record or other object"" to obstruct an official proceeding under the law.

He concluded the statute in question focused on tampering with evidence and did not apply to those allegedly engaged in ""assaultive conduct"" like participating in a riot.

The Justice Department challenged that ruling, and a federal appeals court in Washington agreed with prosecutors that Nichols’ interpretation of the law was too limited.

""The vast majority of courts interpreting the statute have adopted the natural, broad reading"" of the provision, the three-judge appellate panel wrote, ""applying the statute to all forms of obstructive conduct that are not covered"" specifically under that provision. 

Other defendants, including Trump, are separately challenging the use of the charge, but not as part of the current Supreme Court appeal.

The relevant statute — 18 U.S. Code Section 1512(c)(2) — of the Corporate Fraud Accountability Act, part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, states: ""Whoever corruptly … obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.""

Congress passed the law in 2002 after the Enron financial and accounting scandal. Executives at the Texas-based energy company were charged with fraud, and the company eventually went bankrupt.

Judge Nichols in his ruling in the Miller case cited then-Sen. Biden, who referred to the new provision at the time as ""making it a crime for document shredding.""

COMPETING CLAIMS
Both the government and Fischer, who was a North Cornwall Township Police officer in Pennsylvania at the time, offer contrasting accounts of his actions on Jan. 6, 2021.

His lawyers in their high court appeal say Fischer ""was not part of the mob that forced the electoral certification to stop; he arrived at the Capitol grounds well after Congress recessed.""

And while he admits entering the Capitol building and pushing his way through the crowd, Fischer claims he also helpfully returned a pair of lost handcuffs to a U.S. Capitol Police officer. After being pepper-sprayed by law enforcement, the defendant then says he left the complex just four minutes after entering.

But the Justice Department says Fischer ""can be heard on the video yelling 'Charge!' before pushing through the crowd and entering the building. Once inside, petitioner ran toward a line of police officers with another rioter while yelling"" a profanity.

And the government points to text messages he sent just before attending the ""Stop the Steal"" rally where President Trump spoke and the subsequent march to the Capitol.

""Take democratic congress to the gallows,"" he said in one post, and, ""Can't vote if they can't breathe.. lol.""

Fischer has pleaded not guilty to several charges, including disorderly and disruptive conduct; assaulting, resisting or impeding law enforcement officers; civil disorder; and the obstruction count. His trial is pending.

His legal team argues hindering or affecting an official proceeding is too ambiguous, as applied to Fischer's conduct on the Capitol grounds.

""That definition encompasses lobbying, advocacy, and protest, the very mechanisms that citizens employ to influence government. These are all forms of political speech that the First Amendment protects."" 

But the government says Congress in enacting the statute meant it to be applied widely, to include ""corruptly engaging in conduct to obstruct court, agency, and congressional proceedings.""

MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE'S RED LINE ON SPEAKER JOHNSON

""The proof in this case would show that on January 6, 2021, petitioner and other rioters corruptly sought to prevent Congress from counting the certified votes of the Electoral College in the joint session,"" said government lawyers.

Some legal scholars say the conservative high court may be wary of giving the government too much leeway.

""Prosecutors love obstruction statutes, and they love conspiracy statutes, because those statutes are so broad and can be applied in a variety of circumstances to encompass all sorts of conduct,"" said Thomas Dupree, a leading appellate attorney and former top Bush Justice Department official. 

""The Supreme Court is going to look at what was Congress trying to do when it criminalized these things? Did Congress really intend these laws to sweep so far? And can you take a statute that was enacted to address, for example, corporate crimes and apply it to what happened on Jan. 6?""

TRUMP FACTOR 
How a Supreme Court ruling in the Fischer case would affect Trump's separate prosecution for alleged election interference is unclear. If Fischer prevails, the former president could then ask the federal courts to formally dismiss his own obstruction charge.

That could prompt a new round of separate legal appeals that might go back to the Supreme Court for final review.  

Nine days after oral arguments in the Fischer case, the justices will hold a public session to debate whether Trump enjoys absolute immunity from prosecution for conduct in office when allegedly seeking to overturn the 2020 election results and certification.

That has paused Trump's criminal conspiracy and obstruction trial indefinitely.

The separate challenge over the obstruction charge would also likely push the schedule well into next year.

The pending high court case is Fischer v. U.S. (23-5572). A ruling is expected by early summer.
","President Joe Biden and senior members of his national security team, seeking to contain the risk of a wider regional war following a barrage of Iranian missiles and drones directed toward Israel, have told their counterparts the US will not participate in any offensive action against Iran, according to US officials familiar with the matter.

In a conversation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late Saturday, Biden sought to frame Israel’s successful interception of the Iranian onslaught as a major victory — with the suggestion that further Israeli response was unnecessary.

Biden told the Israeli prime minister in his phone call that he should consider Saturday a win because Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful and demonstrated Israel’s superior military capability, a senior administration official said. The US assessed that there was “no significant damage within Israel itself,” according to a senior US military official.

John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, said Sunday the ability to prevent widespread damage was a demonstration of Israel’s “military superiority” and proof that Iran was not the “military power that they claim to be.”

Kirby: Israel’s response to Iran’s attack ‘was an incredible success’
“This was an incredible success, really proving Israel’s military superiority and just as critically, their diplomatic superiority, that they have friends in the region, that they have around the world that are willing to help them,” Kirby told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin asked his Israeli counterpart, Minister Yoav Gallant, to notify the US ahead of any potential response to the Iranian attack, according to another US official.

Even as American officials stressed to their counterparts that the final decision on how to respond to Iran is up to Israel, Biden has sought to prevent a wider escalation of the conflict.

On Sunday, Biden met with his fellow Group of Seven leaders to discuss a “united diplomatic response” — with the emphasis on non-military actions that would limit the prospects of a wider war.

In a joint statement released after the virtual meeting, the G7 members condemned “in the strongest terms” Iran’s “direct and unprecedented attack” against Israel and expressed their “full solidarity and support to Israel and its people and reaffirm our commitment towards its security.”

“With its actions, Iran has further stepped toward the destabilization of the region and risks provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation. This must be avoided,” the G7 statement said.

A senior administration official later described the convening of leaders and their discussion about Iran as “constructive” and stressed ongoing support for Israel.

“We are committed to defending Israel. We would not be a part of any of any response they do. That’s very consistent policy,” the senior administration official said.

Whether Netanyahu takes Biden’s advice remains an open question. The Iranian reprisals came at a moment of deep tension between the men over the war in Gaza. Throughout that conflict, the limits of American influence on Israeli decision-making have been laid bare.

Israel told the United States that it’s not “looking for a significant escalation with Iran,” the senior Biden administration said Sunday.

“The president was very clear that we’re going to help defend Israel, and he made very clear to the prime minister last night that we do have to think carefully and strategically about risks of escalation,” the senior administration official said.

Iran’s decision to fire weapons from its own territory toward Israel significantly ratchets up the long-simmering enmity between the two countries. There will likely be political pressure from inside Israel for some type of response.

Kirby said the attack — the first launched from Iranian soil against Israel — did not necessarily have to constitute the start of a broader regional war.

“We don’t believe it is nor do we believe it has to be,” he told Tapper, noting that the US and Israel both had a good sense of what Iran was planning to do ahead of time.

Gallant warned Sunday that the confrontation with Iran is “not over yet.” The country’s response options are expected to be discussed in detail during a meeting of Israel’s war cabinet meeting.

The Commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, warned that Tehran would respond directly if Israel retaliates, saying a “new equation” had been created.

Tense moments in the Situation Room
Biden gathered Saturday with his national security team for “real-time updates” on Iran’s attack against Israel – at times leading to “tense moments” in the White House Situation Room.

One of those tense moments occurred when over 100 ballistic missiles were in the sky, with a short travel time to Israel.

“The results of the defenses, of course, were unclear until all was said and done. As the results of the defenses came in, which is when we knew that preparations and planning had succeeded, there was a bit of a relief,” the senior administration official said.

US officials have touted ongoing preparations ahead of Iran’s attack, which had been anticipated since a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria earlier this month.

Preparations ahead of Saturday’s attack started “nearly two weeks ago,” the senior administration official said, and involved a force posture adjustment, and ongoing discussions with Israelis and other partners in the region, among other measures.

After the White House determined Saturday’s attack was largely defeated, Biden connected with Netanyahu.

Biden has continued to be routinely updated, according to officials. On Sunday morning, the president again gathered his advisers in the Situation Room, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer, and Mideast coordinator Brett McGurk.

This story and headline have been updated with additional reporting.

CNN’s Sharon Braithwaite, Radina Gigova, Catherine Nicholls and Tamar Michaelis contributed to this report.","The Biden administration on Sunday congratulated Israel — along with itself and allies — on their “spectacular” success in fending off an unprecedented barrage of more than 300 Iranian missiles and armed drones, even as it made clear its desire for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government to declare victory and refrain from striking back.

The United States remains “committed to defending Israel,” a senior administration official said, and “what you saw last night,” as Israeli air defense — supplemented by U.S. planes and warships — shot down 99 percent of the Iranian fires, “is what that means in practice. … We are ready to do it again if we have to.”

But this official and others who spoke in official briefings, background interviews and on television throughout the day, emphasized that the United States would not participate in any offensive Israeli response against Iran.

“Our aim is to de-escalate regional tensions” and prevent the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza from becoming a wider conflagration, the senior official said.

The attack, launched from Iranian territory and by its proxies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, came after two tense weeks during which Iran publicly promised it would retaliate for Israel’s deadly airstrike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria on April 1. The likelihood of an unprecedented direct Iranian attack on Israel quickly consumed the administration, overshadowing concerns about the dire situation in Gaza that had brought President Biden to warn he might have to reconsider U.S. policy toward Israel.

Israeli officials on Sunday expressed conviction that the Iranian attack could turn the tables in terms of widespread international criticism over its actions in Gaza, earning them sympathy as a victim of an Iranian government that is arguably equally unpopular. But there is little sign of progress in efforts to impose a cease-fire in Gaza, where Hamas over the weekend rejected the latest offer from Israel for at least a temporary pause in its offensive in exchange for the release of Hamas-held hostages. A Hamas statement reiterated demands for a full cease-fire and immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces.

Biden has been facing criticism from both the left — which has condemned his staunch support of Israel, and lack of sympathy for Palestinian victims in Gaza — and from the right — which has disparaged some of the harder lines he has taken more recently with Netanyahu.

In the face of a direct Iranian threat and to demonstrate what he has long called America’s “ironclad” commitment to Israel’s defense, Biden 10 days ago instructed U.S. military officials to protect it to the “maximum extent possible.” Lines of U.S.-Israel military and government communication, increasingly strained over the past six months of Israel’s offensive action in Gaza, were suddenly opened full-throttle.

As his national security team briefed him during last week’s state visit from Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Biden authorized more U.S. military deployments to the region, including an additional missile destroyer, amid rising fear that an Iranian attack could spiral the region out of control.

When it became clear the attack was imminent, the president rushed back to the White House on Saturday afternoon from his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del. He spent much of the evening with senior national security aides in the Situation Room watching and being briefed on Iranian launches and subsequent shootdowns in real time, with more than 100 ballistic missiles over the sky at one point.

“You could imagine those tense moments,” one of the officials in the room who briefed reporters Sunday said.

Officials described the action in the skies of the Middle East as a ballet of highly coordinated maneuvers requiring deconfliction of antimissile fires from Israel, U.S. destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean and a U.S.-crewed Patriot missile defense battery in Iraq, while Israeli and U.S. aircraft shot down explosive drones. Most of the interceptions, Israeli and U.S. officials said, were before the missiles had reached Israeli airspace.

What is considered an offensive strike can be elastic within the Pentagon, allowing the Biden administration to take preemptive military action but describe it as defensive in nature. For instance, U.S. forces targeted Houthi missile sites over the past several months before they could launch missiles against shipping in the Red Sea, saying the operation was meant to protect potential targets from attack.

At about 9 p.m., Biden spoke with Netanyahu, who was with his own war cabinet in Israel’s war room monitoring the situation. “It was shortly after we believed the attack was largely defeated,” said the senior administration official. “Both leaders had just gone through 10 days of preparations” and seeing the results, “we were feeling pretty good about where we were.”

U.S. officials characterized the scope of the Iranian attack as at the “high end” of what they had anticipated, and intended “to cause significant damage and death.” But very few Iranian weapons had reached the ground in Israel, causing only minor destruction.

After congratulating Netanyahu, Biden noted that their success had created “space and flexibility for decisions on next steps.” He advised Israel to “slow things down and think through” how to respond.

“It was a very useful call just to kind of talk through where we are,” the senior official said. “Nobody wants to run up the escalation ladder here.” While any response “is a calculation the Israelis have to make … we think that in the overall exchange the Israelis came out clearly very much on top and demonstrated their ability to defend their country in coordination” with the United States and with participation from Britain, France, Jordan and others. “The big question is not only what, but whether Israel chooses” to respond, the official said. “The president and the prime minister really were thinking through strategically where we are.”

This official and others emphasized that the United States would not be part of any Israeli offensive attack against Iran, and wanted to avoid regional escalation. Asked on NBC’s “Meet the Press” whether Biden essentially told Netanyahu to “take the win,” John Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council said, “I think the president was, again, very clear with Prime Minister Netanyahu about the success that they enjoyed last night and the impact that that success ought to have.”


Kirby: U.S. seeks de-escalation with Iran

While messages were exchanged indirectly between the United States and Iran through the government of Switzerland as the crisis built over the past 10 days, officials denied reports that the Iranians had given a 72-hour warning to Washington or countries in the region that the attack was about to start. “That is absolutely not true,” the senior administration official said. “They did not give a notification, nor did they give any sense of these are the targets. … They were clearly intending to destroy targets. … They just didn’t succeed.”

Public saber-rattling from Iran that it would respond to the Israeli attack on its personnel in Damascus “gave us time to prepare,” and Iran also “needed time to prepare to do this,” the official said.

At one point during Saturday evening, “we received a message from the Iranians … through the Swiss, basically suggesting that they were finished. But it was still an ongoing attack.”

Kirby was also asked whether Biden has ruled out the United States launching a direct attack on Iran. “The president has made it clear: We do not seek a war with Iran,” he said. “We don’t seek a wider war in the region.”

On Sunday morning, Biden met again with his senior defense and diplomatic officials in the Situation Room, reviewing the results that they deemed Israel’s “spectacular defeat” of the attack.

Biden also met virtually with the Group of Seven, with some discussions about additional sanctions on Iran. He also called Jordanian King Abdullah II, who has been a crucial ally amid the escalating tensions in the region.

“We, the Leaders of the G7, unequivocally condemn in the strongest terms Iran’s direct and unprecedented attack against Israel. Iran fired hundreds of drones and missiles towards Israel,” the group said in a statement on Sunday afternoon. “Israel, with the help of its partners, defeated the attack.”

Some Republicans, in the immediate aftermath of the attack, criticized Biden for not being more forceful with Iran, or in backing any Israeli response.

“What I don’t understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn’t think [Israel] should respond at all,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on CNN. “It is the continuing part of this public game that they are playing, which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah, which we haven’t even talked about, and the Houthis, and all these other elements, that are targeting Israel.”

Later on Sunday, Biden spoke with top House and Senate leaders from both parties, urging the House to pass a national security spending bill as soon as possible. The Senate in February passed a $95 billion package that included funding for Israel, as well as Ukraine and Taiwan, but a fractious House GOP hasn’t taken it up. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Republicans would “try again this week” to pass some sort of aid package for Israel, but what that package looks like — and whether it includes funding for Ukraine — is likely to be the subject of intense debate.

Criticism of what Rubio and others describe as Biden’s failure to confront Iran began with the administration’s unsuccessful attempts to reinstate a nuclear deal with Tehran that President Donald Trump withdrew from in 2018. The agreement, which also included Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, along with the European Union, held Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon in check in exchange for lifting sanctions.

Six years later, the restraints have fallen away, one by one, leaving Iran closer to nuclear weapons capability than at any time in the country’s history. With those advances, the risk of an escalation of conflict between Iran and nuclear-armed Israel has taken on a new level of threat.

At the United Nations, where the Security Council on Sunday afternoon held the latest of dozens of meetings on the regional crisis — most of them focused on the Israel-Hamas war — some of the United States’ harshest critics, including Russia and China, placed much of the blame for this weekend’s confrontation on U.S. failure to condemn Israel’s April 1 attack on Iran in Damascus.

Iran’s U.N. ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani told the council that Tehran does not seek escalation and “has no intention of engaging in conflict with the U.S.” despite the U.S. role in intercepting Iranian drones and missiles. But Iran would not hesitate to act in self-defense in response to further “military provocation” from Israel, and would respond “proportionately” if the United States initiates military operations against Iran or its security and interests, Iravani said","More than five decades after a second world war veteran was killed while working as a milkman in Florida, investigators say they have solved the case thanks to two people who came forward after the killer died.

Hiram “Ross” Grayam was delivering milk in April 1968 and failed to return home after work. Deputies later found his body and his milk truck deep in the woods in the Vero Beach area, the Indian River county sheriff’s office said in a news release. He had been shot several times.

The case went cold, and no arrests were made during the next 56 years.

“Through determination and the cooperation of witnesses, new leads emerged: Thomas J Williams, now deceased, had confessed to Grayam’s murder, his guilt echoing from beyond the grave,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement.

Grayam, a decorated second world war veteran who received a Purple Heart, had become “a beloved milkman” after settling in Indian River county after the war, authorities said.

A witness told deputies she saw Grayam talking to two men who were walking on the side of the road, WPEC-TV reported.

“She said that Mr Grayam engaged them in conversation, and announced that he would be back shortly,” the Indian River county sheriff, Eric Flowers, said. The two unidentified men and Grayam all left in the milk truck, he said.

Grayam’s family didn’t realize anything had happened, “except my father was a little late in coming home, and then a sheriff’s deputy, an investigator showed up”, Grayam’s son Larry, who was 16 at the time, told the TV station.

During a search of the area by ground and by air, the milk truck and Graham’s body were spotted by an airplane.

“When they arrived at the initial scene, Mr. Grayam was laying next to the milk truck with bullet wounds, killed execution style,” Flowers said.

In 2006, there were rumors that Williams might have been involved. He wrote a letter to the editor of the local newspaper “saying that he had been accused of the murder, but he denied having knowledge of it, that he wasn’t involved in it”, the sheriff said.

The case went cold again, and Williams died in 2016.

With Williams now dead, detectives got huge breaks in the case in the past two years: Williams’s ex-wife and a friend of his sister came forward, telling investigators what they knew, the Florida TV station reported.

Flowers said that the witnesses – neither of whom know each other – told investigators that Williams had previously confessed to them that he had killed Grayam.

“These folks said, ‘I would have never said anything to you before, as long as he was alive, he was a threat to me and my family, we would have never told you,’ but the fact that he is now dead gave them the courage to come forward,” Flowers said.

Detectives hope that anyone who knows about the second man seen with Grayam before he was killed will contact them","In early May 2016, as the political world began to consider questions about Donald Trump and his relationship with Vladimir Putin, the then-candidate was asked whether he’d spoken to the Russian leader. “I don’t want to say,” the Republican replied.

A day later, Trump sat down with Fox News’ Bret Baier, who followed up on the question. “Yeah, I have no comment on that,” the future president replied. “No comment.”

The Fox host, apparently surprised, said one of the things people liked about the candidate was his willingness ""to answer any question.” Trump didn’t seem to care. “Yeah, but I don’t want to comment.”

It was an early indication that the Russia scandal was problematic for Trump. After all, the Republican hardly ever said, “No comment” in response to any question on any subject. He loved, and continues to love, commenting — even when he has no idea what he’s talking about. But asked about whether he’d had direct interactions with Putin, the then-candidate suddenly had nothing to say.

Nearly eight years later, Trump was asked at a Mar-a-Lago press conference whether he’d spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

“I don’t want to say who I spoke to,” the presumptive GOP nominee replied.


The question that doesn’t yet have an answer, of course, is why, exactly, Trump doesn’t want to say whom he’s spoken to.

In fact, as we discussed a couple of weeks ago, the former president appears to be executing a foreign policy of his own — despite the fact that he’s a private citizen with no power, no office, and no governmental authority. Trump reportedly welcomed British Foreign Secretary David Cameron to Mar-a-Lago, for example, which came on the heels of the former president also welcoming Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to his glorified country club.

Trump has also reportedly had direct recent interactions with Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Those accounts roughly coincided with related reporting on Richard Grenell, a former diplomat and intelligence official in Trump’s administration, who has apparently had recent meetings with a variety of far-right leaders around the world.

After Iran’s strikes, Biden pitches a ‘take the win’ line with Israel
The former president has taken to describing Grenell as his “envoy,” despite the fact that it can get a little tricky when presidential candidates have their own envoys — whose goals, messages, and priorities might differ from that of the current U.S. administration.

Let’s not forget that while Trump was in the White House, he called for the prosecution of former Secretary of State John Kerry because the Massachusetts Democrat interacted with foreign officials without coordinating with the Trump administration.

In 2019, the then-president — who routinely tried to get the Justice Department to prosecute political figures he disliked — insisted that Kerry “should be prosecuted” for violating the Logan Act, adding, “He’s talking to Iran and has had many meetings and many phone calls and he’s telling them what to do. That is total violation of the Logan Act.”

Trump had no idea what he was talking about, but he appeared convinced that a former U.S. official interacting with foreign governments was both scandalous and criminal.

So, does the former president still believe this?","Members of a Marine scout sniper team who believed they could have taken out the suicide bomber ahead of the catastrophic attack at Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport during the final days of the American withdrawal from Afghanistan were mistaken, a review ordered by U.S. Central Command has determined.

""Over the past two years, some service members have claimed that they had the bomber in their sights and they could have prevented the attack. We now know that is not correct,"" a member of the supplemental review team, which was tasked with building on the military's initial investigation by taking into account newer information and claims that have surfaced, told reporters in a recent briefing.

In another significant revelation, members of the team identified Abdul Rahman al-Logari as the terrorist responsible for killing 13 American service members and some 170 Afghans when on Aug. 26 2021 he detonated a suicide vest laden with 20 pounds of military-grade explosives near the airport's Abbey Gate. The blast sent a mass of 5-millimeter ball bearings ripping through the densely-packed crowd. This is the first time U.S. officials have confirmed al-Logari was the bomber.

Al-Logari had been a member of the Islamic State in Khorasan Province group, or ISIS-K, since 2016, according to a member of the review team from the Army.

At one point detained by coalition forces, al-Logari was one of the many prisoners indiscriminately released by the Taliban as its fighters swept to take control of the country from Afghan security forces — mostly without a fight — in the days just before the bombing, a second team member said.

ISIS-K took credit for the carnage at Abbey Gate shortly after the attack, claiming al-Logari was behind the atrocity.

U.S. intelligence compared a photo of the alleged bomber posted by ISIS-K and photos of al-Logari taken during his time in coalition custody, using facial analysis to determine it was the same person, according to one of the officials. The U.S. intelligence community went on to verify al-Logari was indeed the suicide bomber, according to the first review team member.

Even if the bomber had not been freed by the Taliban, ISIS-K would still have been able to carry out the bombing, the second official said.

""They had multiple bombers that were available,"" the official said. ""And this supports the conclusion that the attack at Abbey Gate was not preventable at the tactical level.""

GOP congress members have repeatedly raised the possibility the bombing could have been prevented in their attacks on the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal, largely based on testimony from former Marine Sgt. Tyler Vargas-Andrews, a member of one of the sniper teams providing overwatch near Abbey Gate.

In a March 2023 House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Vargas-Andrews claimed his team had spotted a suspicious man matching a description they were given of the suspected Abbey Gate bomber, but were denied permission to fire and prevent the blast, which claimed two of his own limbs.

The top U.S. general in the Middle East during the withdrawal, now-retired Gen. Kenneth ""Frank"" McKenzie, told lawmakers of the same committee last month that he was not aware of any intelligence alerts given to U.S. forces at the time that match the description of the man spotted by the sniper team.

Florida Republican Rep. Cory Mills accused McKenzie of calling the Marine's integrity into question, asking, ""Do you want to face him and tell him that before him now?""

""I don't want to face him and tell him that. I want to say that the battlefield is a very complex place. There were a lot of threats that were floating around out there that day. I honor his service. I regret he was injured,"" McKenzie responded.

The supplemental review team likewise found that the man spotted by the sniper teams did not match descriptions given by any intelligence reports, adding that no specific individual was identified as the bomber by intelligence before the attack. The reviewers concluded the Marines were errantly going off of a description that conflated some pieces of an intelligence report on one man with elements of an informal ""spot report"" describing a different suspicious individual seen by other troops near the airport perimeter.

They and other service members honed in on a ""bald man in black"" who didn't precisely match any actual be-on-the-lookout reports at the time, according to the review. Even authentic description reports of suspicious individuals were often vague enough to have matched any number of people in the crowd, according to the review.

Furthermore, the review team compared a photo taken by the sniper team of the man they believed could have been the bomber with photos of al-Logari, and determined with great confidence that they were not the same person.

The first Army review official said that al-Logari did not linger in the crowd, but detonated his vest just after arriving at Abbey Gate. This makes it very unlikely even the trained observers of the Marine sniper teams could have picked him out of the masses in time, especially since there was no description of the terrorist before the attack, according to the official.

""I must reiterate by saying that service members were vigilant in their duties,"" the official said. ""Yet, the intelligence available lacked targetable data to gain positive identification of the bomber prior to the attack. The suspicious person identified by a sniper team was not the Abbey Gate bomber.""

The military plans to release a redacted version of the full 1,200-page supplemental report to the public at an unspecified date, an Army official said.","Federal authorities are investigating the events that preceded the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, according to two people familiar with the matter. 

The FBI currently has agents on the Dali, the shipping vessel that collided with the bridge. Six people died after the collision.

The investigation, which appears to be separate from the ongoing National Transportation Safety Board probe, is being conducted by the Maryland U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI, entities that have had representatives at the crash site for weeks. 

The Washington Post was the first to report the news of the federal investigation. 

A spokesperson for the FBI said Monday in a statement, ""FBI is present aboard the cargo ship Dali conducting court authorized law enforcement activity. There is no other public information available and we will have no further comment."" A Justice Department spokesperson confirmed federal agents are aboard. 

In a statement released Monday, Maryland U.S. Attorney Erek Barron said, ""My office generally will not confirm the existence of or otherwise comment about investigations. However, the public should know, whether it's gun violence, civil rights abuse, financial fraud, or any other threat to public safety or property, we will seek accountability for anyone who may be responsible."" 

Attorneys for the corporation that owns the Dali did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment. 

The Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore collapsed around 1:30 a.m. on March 26 after the Dali, a massive Singaporean-flagged cargo ship, crashed into a bridge column. According to the NTSB, the ship made mayday calls saying they lost power at 1:26 a.m. and a collision might be possible. Records from 911 indicated that officials asked police to block traffic on either side of the bridge shortly before the collision, with two emergency responders confirming traffic had been stopped on the north and south sides of the bridge. 

Eight construction workers were still on the bridge. Two were injured and survived, while bodies of another were recovered. The other three are presumed dead. ","As the dust settled across the Middle East after a fraught weekend that saw Iran launch a swarm of more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel, Jordan’s foreign minister hit the Arabic and English-language news shows to hammer home what he sees as the root cause of the dangerous violence roiling the region.

“The issue here is the aggression in Gaza,” Ayman Safadi, Jordan’s top diplomat, told CNN. “The first step” to avoiding a wider war, he said, “is ending the aggression.” 

Like much of the world, Jordan has been fiercely critical of the war in Gaza, where more than 30,000 people have died in Israeli military action since Hamas rampaged across southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200. 

But when Tehran launched its explosive swarm on Saturday, Jordan’s air force took to the sky, shooting down dozens of Iranian drones, joining the U.S., Israel, the United Kingdom and France in a defensive operation that knocked out nearly all the weaponry Tehran aimed at Israeli targets.

Israel remains deeply isolated over its war in Gaza, where even President Joe Biden has now demanded a cease-fire. But when faced with attack by Iran, America’s top Middle East ally gained a lot of friends.

Who are Israel's allies against Iran?
Only a few countries remain that are willing to defend the six-month-old Gaza war, or to at least refrain from publicly criticizing it. On April 4, amid a backlash over the deaths of seven aid workers from chef Jose Andres’ World Central Kitchen, Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyau that future U.S. aid would depend on strong steps to protect civilians and humanitarian staff in Gaza. 

Asked by USA TODAY why it had taken Biden so long to break with Netanyahu in Gaza, former U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk replied, “It goes against his beliefs and is risky when Israel is facing a manifest threat from Iran.”

In the face of that threat, regional strains over Gaza were briefly set aside.

Iranian pro-government supporters shout anti-Israel slogans at Palestine Square in Tehran, on April 14, 2024, in a celebration of the early morning attack on Israel.
“We know that the Jordanian air force shot down dozens of Iranian drones that violated its airspace and were headed to Israel,” Michael Wahid Hanna, an analyst at the International Crisis Group said Monday.Still, Jordan − where one is five residents is Palestinian − was quick to say it wasn't defending Israel. ""There was an assessment that there was a real danger of Iranian barrages and missiles falling on Jordan, and the armed forces dealt with this danger,"" Foreign Minister Safadi told Jordanian state TV. ""And if this danger came from Israel, Jordan would take the same action.""

Some threats are just bigger than others. ""The Arab states make a big show of being publicly furious about Israel’s war on Gaza, but many of these states still perceive Iran as a bigger threat than Israel,"" Mohamad Bazzi, director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies at New York University, told USA TODAY.

Will it spark a wider war?Israel's long-simmering conflict with Iran moves out of the shadows

Saudi Arabia, a fierce critic of the Gaza war, provided intelligence to Israel about the timing of the coming Iranian attack, Reuters reported, while France, which has called for an immediate Gaza cease-fire, also took part in the massive air defense operation on Saturday.

None have signed on to help Israel in a possible armed response to Saturday's attack.

""No regional state is likely to join Israel in attacking Iran,"" Mohammad Ali Shabani, the editor of London-based Amwaj Media, told USA TODAY. ""On the other hand, Iran can be expected to be joined in offensive military operations by its allies in places like Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen.""

Who are Iran's allies against Israel?
Iran has carefully seeded the Middle East with proxy militias over that last 20 yearss, and gained the full support of one regional government, allowing it to project power through a so-called “Axis of Resistance.” 

The axis includes Iran's longtime partner Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, which has turned Israel’s northern border into a potential second front amid exchanges of rocket fire that have  led to the evacuation of Israeli border communities.

Objects are seen in the sky above Jerusalem after Iran launched drones and missiles towards Israel, in Jerusalem on April 14, 2024.
Syria is a member of the axis as well. Iranian and Hezbollah fighters – joined by Russia – helped save the government after Islamist forces including al Qaeda threatened his government amid a general uprising against of President Bashar al Assad's brutal rule. 

In Iraq, Iran supports and directs a number of militias that have in the past attacked American bases in that country. One of them, Kataib Hezbollah, congratulated Iran for its failed attack in a statement on Sunday. “The Zionist-American enemy and his followers only understand the language of weapons to curb their tyranny,” the group said. ""We point out that shame will continue to haunt the rulers of Jordan throughout history.""

And in Yemen, the Iran-supported Houthi movement has fired rockets at Israel and paralyzed global shipping through its attacks on cargo vessels in the Red Sea.

US, Russia, Europe warn of a wider war
Iran launched its broad attack on Israel – its first-ever direct assault on its arch-enemy – after a suspected Israeli airstrike on its embassy compound in Damascus, Syria, killed several people including a top official of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. 

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameni promised revenge.

Now, with Iran’s 300-projectile gambit having caused only minor damage to an Israeli air base, world leaders are calling for calm. Biden has told Netanyahu the U.S. will not join any Israeli response to Saturday’s attack. And on Monday the European Union and Russia also urged restraint. 

Safadi, the Jordanian foreign minister, said that extending the conflict with Iran would help Netanyahu by drawing attention away from a war that has alienated Israel from much of the international community.


Provoking Tehran will “dilute that pressure and take the focus away from Gaza,” Safadi told CNN. “Iran retaliated. It said it would do no more.”

“The regional states remain quite concerned that the longer the open-ended conflict in Gaza goes on, the greater the possibility – through a direct decision or miscalculation –  of a regional war,” Hanna said.

","Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said it's ""absolutely unacceptable"" for the Biden administration to have approved any sort of strike on Israel, as some reporting has suggested happened before Saturday's thwarted attack by Iran.

""Israel is our ally,"" Ernst said on Newsmax's ""Newsline."" ""We should be defending them with our heart and soul, so the Biden administration needs to step up and always represent our best interests in the Middle East and that is by standing with our friend Israel.

""We have seen a number of other Arab nations that have stepped up as well. I want to say thanks so much to Jordan, to Saudi [Arabia], to our other partners across the Middle East that have also stood with Israel in downing these drones and these ballistic missiles.

""I will remind everyone it was the Biden administration that has continued to try and engage in the Iran nuclear deal, which frees up money for the Iranians. They also refused to enforce oil sanctions against Iran.

""We're at a five-year high of oil exports from Iran totaling $80 billion. Those funds go to buy drones and ballistic missiles, which target Israel and our American men and women on the ground throughout the Middle East. Shame on you, President Biden.""

Ernst said that before Tehran's weekend attack, a number of Israeli allies were beginning to pull back their support for the Jewish state's ongoing retaliatory war in the Gaza Strip against Iranian proxy group Hamas.

""We have seen the tide turn now with opinion when it comes to Israel,"" she said. ""So many partners around the world were very concerned about Israel, and started really backing off, but after these weekend attacks, you see a renewed interest in allowing Israel to defend herself.

""She has every right to do that and, in the short term, they should be riding that wave of increased support and finding a way to provide those repercussions to Iran. As they do that, whatever they decide to do, the United States of America should be right there, backing them up, whether it's logistically, whether it is targeting, providing munitions and platforms.

""In the long term, the United States of America again needs to get serious about enforcing sanctions against Iran. I have a bipartisan bill that would do that, would force the administration to enforce those sanctions and then enriching our own investigative capabilities to interdict illicit oil coming out of Iran.

""This is incredibly important that we do this. We need to choke them off where it matters the most, and that is the funds that continue to allow them to buy those missiles, buy those drones and fund terrorist proxies."""
"President Biden wants the world to believe that the biggest obstacle facing Ukraine is Republicans and our lack of commitment to the global community. This is wrong.

Ukraine’s challenge is not the G.O.P.; it’s math. Ukraine needs more soldiers than it can field, even with draconian conscription policies. And it needs more matériel than the United States can provide. This reality must inform any future Ukraine policy, from further congressional aid to the diplomatic course set by the president.

The Biden administration has applied increasing pressure on Republicans to pass a supplemental aid package of more than $60 billion to Ukraine. I voted against this package in the Senate and remain opposed to virtually any proposal for the United States to continue funding this war. Mr. Biden has failed to articulate even basic facts about what Ukraine needs and how this aid will change the reality on the ground.

The most fundamental question: How much does Ukraine need and how much can we actually provide? Mr. Biden suggests that a $60 billion supplemental means the difference between victory and defeat in a major war between Russia and Ukraine. That is also wrong.  This $60 billion is a fraction of what it would take to turn the tide in Ukraine’s favor. But this is not just a matter of dollars. Fundamentally, we lack the capacity to manufacture the amount of weapons Ukraine needs us to supply to win the war.

Consider our ability to produce 155-millimeter artillery shells. Last year, Ukraine’s defense minister estimated that the country’s base-line requirement for these shells was over four million per year but that it could fire up to seven million if that many were available. Since the start of the conflict, the United States has gone to great lengths to ramp up production of 155-millimeter shells. We’ve roughly doubled our capacity and can now produce 360,000 per year — less than a tenth of what Ukraine says it needs. The administration’s goal is to get this to 1.2 million — 30 percent of what’s needed — by the end of 2025. This would cost the American taxpayers dearly while yielding an unpleasantly familiar result: failure abroad.

Just this week, the top American military commander in Europe argued that absent further security assistance, Russia could soon have a 10-to-1 artillery advantage over Ukraine. What didn’t gather as many headlines is that Russia’s current advantage is at least 5 to 1, even after all the money we have poured into the conflict. Neither of these ratios plausibly leads to Ukrainian victory.

Proponents of American aid to Ukraine have argued that our approach has been a boon to our own economy, creating jobs here in the factories that manufacture weapons. But our national security interests can be — and often are — separate from our economic interests. The notion that we should prolong a bloody and gruesome war because it’s been good for American business is grotesque. We can and should rebuild our industrial base without shipping its products to a foreign conflict.

The story is the same when we look at other munitions. Take the Patriot missile system — our premier air defense weapon. It’s of such importance in this war that Ukraine’s foreign minister has specifically demanded them. That’s because in March alone, Russia reportedly launched over 3,000 guided aerial bombs, 600 drones and 400 missiles at Ukraine. To fend off these attacks, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and others have indicated they need thousands of Patriot interceptors per year. The problem is this: The United States only manufactures 550 per year. If we pass the supplemental aid package currently being considered in Congress, we could potentially increase annual production to 650, but that’s still less than a third of what Ukraine requires.

These weapons are not only needed by Ukraine. If China were to set its sights on Taiwan, the Patriot missile system would be critical to its defense. In fact, the United States has promised to send Taiwan nearly $900 million worth of Patriot missiles, but delivery of those weapons and other essential resources has been severely delayed, partly because of shortages caused by the war in Ukraine.

If that sounds bad, Ukraine’s manpower situation is even worse. Here are the basics: Russia has nearly four times the population of Ukraine. Ukraine needs upward of half a million new recruits, but hundreds of thousands of fighting-age men have already fled the country. The average Ukrainian soldier is roughly 43 years old, and many soldiers have already served two years at the front with few, if any, opportunities to stop fighting. After two years of conflict, there are some villages with almost no men left. The Ukrainian military has resorted to coercing men into service, and women have staged protests to demand the return of their husbands and fathers after long years of service at the front. This newspaper reported one instance in which the Ukrainian military attempted to conscript a man with a diagnosed mental disability.

Many in Washington seem to think that hundreds of thousands of young Ukrainians have gone to war with a song in their heart and are happy to label any thought to the contrary Russian propaganda. But major newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic are reporting that the situation on the ground in Ukraine is grim.

These basic mathematical realities were true, but contestable, at the outset of the war. They were obvious and incontestable a year ago, when American leadership worked closely with Mr. Zelensky to undertake a disastrous counteroffensive. The bad news is that accepting brute reality would have been most useful last spring, before the Ukrainians launched that extremely costly and unsuccessful military campaign. The good news is that even now, a defensive strategy can work. Digging in with old-fashioned ditches, cement and land mines are what enabled Russia to weather Ukraine’s 2023 counteroffensive. Our allies in Europe could better support such a strategy, as well. While some European countries have provided considerable resources, the burden of military support has thus far fallen heaviest on the United States.

By committing to a defensive strategy, Ukraine can preserve its precious military manpower, stop the bleeding and provide time for negotiations to commence. But this would require both the American and Ukrainian leadership to accept that Mr. Zelensky’s stated goal for the war — a return to 1991 boundaries — is fantastical.

The White House has said time and again that it can’t negotiate with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. This is absurd. The Biden administration has no viable plan for the Ukrainians to win this war. The sooner Americans confront this truth, the sooner we can fix this mess and broker for peace.","Former President Donald Trump pulled in millions at a fundraiser in a swanky neighborhood of Atlanta that has for years railed against the Democrat-led city's spiraling crime rate and lack of support for the police - even working to secede from the city altogether over the policies. 

""Our digital online fundraising continues to skyrocket, our major donor investments are climbing, and Democrats are running scared of the fundraising prowess of President Trump. We are not only raising the necessary funds, but we are deploying strategic assets that will help send President Trump back to the White House and carry Republicans over the finish line,"" Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital of fundraising efforts this week. 

Trump attended a fundraiser Wednesday afternoon in Buckhead, a wealthy commercial and residential district in Atlanta, where local leaders joined the 45th president, including: former Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, as well as the co-founder of Home Depot, Bernie Marcus, and poultry industry tycoon Tommy Bagwell, Fox 5 reported. 

Trump pulled in more than $15 million on Wednesday, from both the Buckhead event and another fundraiser in Orlando, a campaign official said. Guests in Buckhead spent at least $6,600 per couple, and as much as $250,000 if they wished to be part of the event's welcoming committee, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

The Buckhead fundraiser comes after Trump has repeatedly hammered a return of law and order policies across the nation if he’s re-elected come Nov. 5.

For Buckhead residents, spiraling crime rates have been a hot-button issue they have not taken lightly. 

Dubbed the ""Beverly Hills of the South,"" residents of the Atlanta district tried to secede from the city back in 2021 through last year, as violent crimes such as homicides continued an upward trend, as well as when vehicle thefts and shoplifting spiked.

The wealthy district has a median household income of $109,774, with residents accounting for roughly one-fifth of Atlanta’s total population, according to the district’s website. Bloomberg calculated last year that the district produces about 38% of Atlanta’s tax revenue, meaning a secession likely would have been financially devastating for the city.

Residents railed that city leaders weren't properly handling crime as taxpayers paid the price. 

""We are really feeling like this is a war zone, and I don't say that lightly, especially given what you experienced in a war zone,"" Buckhead City Committee CEO Bill White told ""Fox & Friends First"" back in 2022. ""This is murder and mayhem… We are dealing with a mayor who voted to defund the police.""

Atlanta recorded a 30-year record high in homicides in 2021, at 158 deaths, while reports of rape skyrocketed by 236% in the first few months of 2022 compared to the same time period the year prior, motor vehicle thefts shot up by 61% in 2023 and shoplifting increased by 22% last year. Violent crimes in the city have since ticked down, but just this week, police in Atlanta announced they were investigating a shooting outside a Buckhead furniture store that left a man in critical condition, Fox 5 reported.

Violent crimes skyrocketed across the nation in 2020, when the pandemic’s lockdowns upended day-to-day life, and protests and riots spread across the nation following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police. Activists and left-wing politicians echoed calls to defund the police in response to Floyd’s killing, including in Atlanta where the mayor at the time championed that the city had already been working on plans ""reallocating"" policing funds to c​​ommunity-based initiatives.

Experts who have previously spoken to Fox Digital have pinned blame on 2020's crime trend in part on anti-police rhetoric that washed over the nation, spurring mass resignations and early retirements from the force, as well as cops pulling back from proactively policing.

""It's obvious that police officers do not want to come work for a mayor or a city that does not back them, so Buckhead wants to take things into its own hands,"" White said during the ""Fox & Friends"" interview in 2022. 

""We're short 180 police officers, so what are we supposed to do?"" White continued. ""They said this has never been done taking a part of a city out and making its own city from that, but we're going to do it, and we're going to absolutely love our police."" 

TRUMP CAMPAIGN RAISES MORE THAN $50 MILLION AT FLORIDA FUNDRAISER: 'HISTORIC' HAUL

The effort to secede received support from some local Republican leaders, and notably received Trump’s backing, who railed against ""RINO"" politicians who did not come to the aid of residents demanding assistance with crime trends.

""What is happening in the City of Atlanta is nothing short of disgraceful. It’s national news and a regional embarrassment. The good people of Buckhead don’t want to be a part of defunding the police and the high crime that’s plaguing their communities,"" Trump wrote in February of 2022. ""However, RINOs like Governor Brian Kemp, the man responsible, along with his puppet master Mitch McConnell, for the loss of two Senate Seats and 2020 Presidential Vote, Lt. Governor Jeff Duncan, Speaker David Ralston, and State Senators Butch Miller, Jeff Mullis, and John Albers always talk a big game but they don’t deliver. 

""What good is having Republican leaders if they are unwilling to fight for what they campaigned on? Every RINO must go! Let the voters decide on the very popular City of Buckhead proposal!""

The effort to secede ultimately failed in the state Senate last year, when all Democrats and a handful of Republicans delivered the blow with a 33-23 vote.

This year, Trump has continued hammering the issue of crime trends and public safety, including in New York last month, when he attended the wake of an NYPD officer, Jonathan Diller, who was shot and killed allegedly by a career criminal. Trump called for ""law and order"" outside of the funeral home. 

TRUMP PROMISES TO INDEMNIFY, PROTECT LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLLOWING NYPD JONATHAN DILLER'S DEATH

""The other day I was very honored to visit the family of an amazing man, New York Police Detective Jonathan Diller. You read about it, who was gunned down by a vicious thug, who was originally arrested by different law enforcement agencies over twenty-one times for very serious crimes. And the person with them was a known killer,"" Trump said days later at a campaign stop in Wisconsin. 

""We will very importantly restore law and order to our country, and I'm going to indemnify all police officers and law enforcement officials throughout the United States to protect them from being destroyed by the radical left for taking strong actions on crime,"" Trump said.

Ahead of Trump’s fundraising event in Buckhead, the 45th president pulled in more than $50 million at a GOP fundraiser in Palm Beach on Saturday. ","Donald Trump will make history when he arrives in lower Manhattan Monday morning as the first former president to go on trial for criminal charges.

Despite a blitz of last-minute attempts to derail the trial, jury selection is expected to get underway and will continue until a panel of 12 New Yorkers and alternates are seated, a process that could take at least a week.

The historic trial centers on a potential sex scandal coverup that took place just days before the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors allege Trump falsified business records to hide the reimbursement of hush money payments that were made to influence the election outcome. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has denied having an affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels.

The case will be a major test for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, as it may be the only one of Trump’s four criminal cases to face a jury before Election Day. Trump will trade the campaign trail for the courtroom, where the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is expected to be four days a week for the next two months.

The former president has used his court appearances to rally supporters for his campaign but, despite his showmanship, the stakes for Trump are high. Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. If convicted, Judge Juan Merchan, the no-nonsense judge overseeing the trial, could sentence Trump to probation or a maximum sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison. A president has no authority to pardon state crimes.

The trial will pit witnesses once in Trump’s inner circle against the former president, including his onetime attorney and former fixer Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance charges; long-time friend and former CEO of the company that published the National Enquirer, David Pecker, who executed “catch and kill” deals; and campaign confidante Hope Hicks.

It will also take the jury inside the Oval Office, where prosecutors allege then-President Trump signed-off on the cover-up that involved falsifying business records – invoices, ledger entries and checks – to reimburse Cohen for phony legal services. And it may feature at least one audio recording of Trump and Cohen allegedly discussing a catch and kill deal.

Despite the salacious nature of the allegations, a lot of testimony will likely focus on mundane back-office recordkeeping. Prosecutors said there are 18 witnesses they may call to enter financial documents into the case if both sides aren’t able to reach an agreement about their authenticity.

The burden of proof
Prosecutors need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records with the intent to commit or conceal another crime, but they don’t have to prove that Trump committed that crime. The prosecution theory is that second crime could be in violation of federal and state election laws or state tax laws for how the Cohen reimbursement was handled.

Trump poses unique challenges for jury in his hush money trial
Trump’s attorneys have kept their defense close to the vest, but in court filings they’ve indicated that they plan to attack the credibility of Daniels and Cohen and paint them as liars who are motivated by grudges and money.

His legal team is led by Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, two former federal prosecutors from New York, and Susan Necheles, a veteran criminal defense lawyer with deep experience in New York and before Merchan. Necheles represented Trump’s business at its tax fraud trial in 2022. The company was convicted.

Outside lawyers who have been following the case closely say Trump is likely to argue that hush money payments are legal and distance Trump from the repayment scheme and bookkeeping handled by his trusted employees. They may also argue the payments were made to prevent embarrassment to Trump’s family and not to influence the election.

Trump’s lawyers said they plan to call at least two witnesses in their case: Bradley Smith, a former commissioner of the Federal Election Commission, and Alan Garten, the top legal officer of the Trump Organization. Merchan has limited the scope of Smith’s testimony to describing the role and function of the FEC and defining certain terms, such as campaign contributions, but has blocked him from testifying about whether the law was violated in this case.

Trump could also testify in his own defense. He has testified in two recent civil trials, after regretting not taking the stand in a prior civil trial, but the stakes are higher in a criminal case.

The doorman, the model, and the porn star
The trial goes back to the final days of the 2016 presidential election when Stormy Daniels was about to go public with allegations that she had sex with Trump in 2006 at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. The Access Hollywood tape catching Trump on a hot mic speaking graphically about his proclivity to grope women had just come out, sending panic into his campaign as it sought to limit the impact on female voters, prosecutors allege.

New York ratchets up security for Trump’s trial now that he’s the presumptive GOP nominee
Trump’s allies scrambled to pay Daniels hush money to prevent her from speaking out, the indictment alleges.

It was the third “catch and kill” deal to come after a key meeting at Trump Tower in August 2015 between Trump, Cohen and Pecker. At the meeting, which was held one month after Trump announced his candidacy, Pecker allegedly agreed to be the “eyes and ears” for the campaign to look out for negative stories, according to the indictment.

In 2015, American Media, the then-publisher of the National Enquirer, paid a doorman to bury a false story and the following year the publisher paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy playmate who said she had a sexual relationship with Trump while he was married, $150,000 for her silence and offered her two magazine cover stories.

Two months later, on October 7, the Access Hollywood tape was released. On October 27, 2016, Cohen wired the money to Daniels and 12 days later Trump won the election.

The alleged cover up
Prosecutors allege that Trump agreed to reimburse Cohen, who hammered out the details with Allen Weisselberg, the former longtime chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. As part of the alleged scheme, the Trump Organization paid Cohen $420,000 to reimburse him for the payment, some political work, taxes and a bonus. According to prosecutors, the Trump Organization noted on the checks to Cohen and in their books that the payments were legal expenses pursuant to a retainer agreement.","SCHNECKSVILLE, Pa. — “Genocide Joe” is a phrase used by pro-Palestine protesters against President Biden because of his unconditional support of Israel amid its onslaught in Gaza.

But supporters of former president Donald Trump adopted the chant at his campaign rally Saturday night — even as Trump similarly pledged unconditional support of Israel hours after Iran launched retaliatory drone and missile strikes into the country this weekend.

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.
Supporters began to chant “genocide Joe, genocide Joe,” as Trump spoke from a stage in a large field at the Schnecksville fire hall.

Trump paused before saying: “They’re not wrong, they’re not wrong. He’s done everything wrong.”

Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles toward Israel on Saturday, most of which were intercepted by Israel, the United States and their allies. The assault, in retaliation for Israel’s attack on an Iranian diplomatic facility two weeks ago, has been widely condemned by world leaders including Biden, who pledged “ironclad” support for Israeli security.

It’s unclear what exactly Trump’s rallygoers intended by chanting “genocide Joe,” a phrase deployed by some Arab American and Muslim voters as well as progressives, who have criticized Biden for continuing to send weapons to Israel as its military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel launched its war in the enclave after Hamas militants rampaged through the Israel-Gaza border fence on Oct. 7 and killed an estimated 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took about 250 others hostage.

Democratic voters in Michigan, Wisconsin and other states have organized efforts to vote “uncommitted” or “uninstructed” in their states’ primaries instead of for Biden as a warning to the president that he could lose their votes in November if he does not call for a permanent cease-fire and end military aid to Israel.

Congressional Republicans have urged more U.S. support for Israel, although the Republican-controlled House has yet to take up a bill passed months ago in the Democratic-controlled Senate that would send aid to Israel along with Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific.

Trump kicked off his Saturday rally by claiming the attack from Iran “would not have happened” if he were president, though he did not explain how he would have prevented it.

“I want to say God bless the people of Israel. They’re under attack right now,” he said. “We show great weakness.”

In the final days of Trump’s presidency in 2020, Iran attacked a U.S. base in Iraq, with dozens of soldiers suffering traumatic brain injuries as a result.","“Ironclad,” said Joe Biden. “Ironclad,” said Lloyd Austin, the defense secretary. “Ironclad,” said the Senate leader Chuck Schumer, the House leader Hakeem Jeffries and the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer.

In the wake of Saturday’s attack by Iran, Democrats united around a single word in expressing their commitment to Israel’s security. It was a sentiment that papered over, at least for now, cracks in the party over Biden’s handling of the war in Gaza.

But Biden’s renewed embrace of Israel could deepen further a row over US support for Israel’s war in Gaza that has engulfed the Democratic party and pitted the White House against its progressive wing – a split that could sap Biden’s support in November’s crucial presidential election.

These have been trying weeks for the US president. As Gaza’s death toll climbs and famine looms, criticism of Israel’s conduct of the war has been growing from the left and even the centre, with some calling for an end to US arms supplies.

Tens of thousands of people registered “uncommitted” protest votes against Biden in the Democratic primary election, including in swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, a grim portent ahead of the presidential election against Donald Trump in November.

This pressure, and the recent deaths of World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza, seemed to finally prompt a shift in Biden’s tone. Last week he branded Israel’s handling of the war a “mistake”. Even then he remained passive-aggressive, declining to impose any tangible consequences.

Then, on Saturday, Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel on Saturday night in response to a suspected Israel attack on Iran’s Syria consulate on 1 April. Biden, cutting short a weekend stay at his Delaware beach house to meet with his national security team at the White House, was back in his instinctive comfort zone. His entire political career has been shaped by the view of Israel as a vulnerable ally in a hostile neighborhood that needs unequivocal US support.

In an instant, the atmospherics in Washington changed. Schumer, who surprised many last month by calling for new elections in Israel, issued a statement that said “we stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Israel” and made no mention of Gaza.

The Democratic senator John Fetterman, no friend of pro-Palestinian protesters, told CNN’s State of the Union: “It really demonstrates how it’s astonishing that we are not standing firmly with Israel and there should never be any kinds of conditions on all of that. When a nation can launch hundreds of drones towards Israel, I’m not going to be talking about conditions, ever.”

And on NBC’s flagship Meet the Press, John Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesperson, gushed over “an incredible military achievement by Israel and quite frankly the United States and other partners that helped Israel defend itself against more than three hundred drones and missiles”.

He added: “And I think Israel also demonstrated that it has friends, that it’s not standing alone, that it’s not isolated on the world stage.”

Republicans seized on the attack to accuse Biden of weak leadership, claiming that only Trump could restore peace and stability to the world. Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee called for “aggressive retaliatory strikes on Iran”.

If they succeed in shifting the terms of the debate, it will be even harder for the president to signal a break from Netanyahu. Amid the drumbeat for rallying against a common foe, Democrats who call for military aid to be conditioned will be accused of tone deaf appeasement.

On Sunday, the Washington news agenda was dominated by speculation over Biden can dissuade Netanyahu from striking back – “Take the win,” he reportedly said – and prevent a wider regional war, and whether Congress might now pass military aid for both Israel and Ukraine.

Gaza – where Israel’s offensive has killed at least 33,729 people, mostly women and children, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry – was no longer uppermost in the thoughts of politicians or the journalists who interview them.

Progressives and protesters had come a long way in forcing Biden to question his most deeply held convictions and warn Netanyahu that enough is enough. The events of Saturday night shook the kaleidoscope yet again and may give the US president a different political and electoral calculus, an excuse to return to his default position. Yet people in Gaza are still dying, and many would-be Biden supporters are still angry about it.","Iranian retaliation against Israel was inevitable the moment Israeli aircraft bombed an Iranian diplomatic facility in the heart of Damascus on April 1, killing one of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) top generals and several other Iranian military advisers in the process.

Iran’s political and religious leadership telegraphed as much immediately after the Israeli strike occurred. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi called it a “cowardly crime” that wouldn’t go unanswered. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, used his weekly speech to declare that Israel would be “punished.” The Biden administration took Khamenei’s words seriously: U.S. government employees in Israel were ordered to stay in the major cities; Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with his Arab foreign ministerial colleagues and asked them to urge Iran to de-escalate; and the Defense Department repositioned two U.S. Navy destroyers into regional waters, at least one of which carries a sophisticated missile defense system.

The leaders of Israel and the U.S. must now weigh the risks and rewards of an Israeli counterstrike.

The question was never whether Iran would respond but rather how. Now we know: At the time of writing, over 100 drones and missiles were launched by Iran toward Israel. Further drone or even ballistic missile strikes by the Iranians could follow, although this is hardly assured. Either way, a tense regional situation is becoming even more fraught. The leaders of Israel and the U.S. must now weigh the risks and rewards of an Israeli counterstrike. And if counterstrikes are approved, the leaders of both countries will need to determine how long they will tolerate a dangerous escalatory spiral.

This is not a low-cost scenario for the U.S. There are tens of thousands of U.S. troops stationed in the Middle East, from Syria and Iraq to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. All of these troops are within range of Iranian missile fire or Iranian proxy attacks. U.S. military installations in the region would make for tempting targets in the event of a regional conflagration, and no number of air defense systems would be able to shoot down every projectile fired their way.

In January 2020, when the Trump administration assassinated Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Iraq, Iran waited five days before settling on its response (more than a dozen ballistic missiles were launched against two U.S. military facilities in Iraq). This time, Iran took more time, deliberating options over a span of two weeks. 


Days of shifting explanations for the deadly strike on Soleimani

It’s not difficult to see why. Iran had a number of options on the table, ranging from the symbolic to the escalatory. For instance, the Iranians could have utilized their proxy network in the Middle East as they often have against Israel and U.S. troops in the past. Tehran’s conventional military is weak compared to U.S. and Israeli standards, but Iran can still do considerable damage thanks to strategic relationships with nonstate actors like Hezbollah in Lebanon, Palestinian militant groups in Gaza and the West Bank, the Houthis in Yemen, and militias in Iraq and Syria.

In January, three U.S. troops were killed in northeastern Jordan after Iranian-linked militias conducted a drone strike on a U.S. base there. Alternatively, Iran could have tasked its intelligence service with attacking Israeli diplomatic facilities or Israeli diplomats abroad, as it tried to do in Azerbaijan, India, Thailand and Georgia more than a decade ago. An Iranian strike against Israeli territory was the extreme option. It is also unprecedented — Iran has never before authorized a direct attack against Israel from its own soil, let alone one that included a barrage of drones.

An Iranian strike against Israeli territory was the extreme option. It is also unprecedented.

Khamenei couldn’t afford not to retaliate after such a bold Israeli attack. From his perspective, doing too little or doing nothing at all would have exposed the Iranian government as weak, and may have dared Israel to execute more decapitation strikes against high-profile Iranian targets in the future. Doing too much, though, risks blowback and debilitating Israeli counterstrikes. The Iranian military establishment is already antiquated relative to its adversaries. Khamenei, Raisi, the IRGC brass and the Iranian defense apparatus writ large may be rash in their rhetoric, but they know Iran isn’t ready for a full-scale conflict with the region’s most capable military power, let alone one that boasts an intricate military relationship with a global superpower. Indeed, if Tehran’s attack sparks even stronger Israeli military action in Iran, what exactly was the point?

Now Israel has a choice. On Thursday, April 11, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israeli pilots that Israel was prepared for war if need be: “We set a simple principle: Anyone who hits us, we hit them.” Ditto Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant: “We are prepared to defend ourselves on the ground and in the air, in close cooperation with our partners, and we will know how to respond.”

Biden pledges to defend Israel amid threats from Iran
02:49
From Washington’s view, Iran’s attack on Israel is inexcusable. President Joe Biden’s frustration with Netanyahu’s Gaza policy may be growing, but he has been clear that the U.S. stands with Israel unequivocally in the event of an Iranian assault. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the same thing to the Israeli defense minister during an April 11 phone call, insisting Israel could count on “full U.S. support.” What that actually means, and whether the U.S. would join Israel in a hypothetical military operation against Iran, was left for us outsiders to prognosticate about. The implication, however, probably wasn’t lost on Khamenei.

Netanyahu has critical decisions to make. So does Biden. America’s instinct after this incident will be to support Netanyahu unconditionally if he in fact decides to hit Iranian soil.

In this case, however, those instincts would be wrong — not because Israeli action would be unjustified but rather because it has a decent chance of precipitating the very regional war Biden is ostensibly interested in avoiding. U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria have been fortunate to see a two-month downturn in militia rocket and drone attacks on their positions. During a wider war, though, this informal cease-fire could be at risk of rupturing.","New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu on Sunday reaffirmed his support for Donald Trump in the 2024 general election while standing by some -- but not all -- of his past criticism of the former president.

In an interview on ABC News' ""This Week,"" Sununu, a Republican who endorsed former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley over Trump in the GOP primary, was repeatedly pressed by anchor George Stephanopoulos about his previous statements attacking the former president.

Sununu said he stood by a 2021 denunciation of Trump over Jan. 6 but said he no longer believes that Trump should leave the race if he is convicted in one of his four criminal cases. Trump denies all wrongdoing.

In a June 2023 CNN interview, when several Republicans were vying for the primary nomination against Trump, Sununu said that Trump should drop out of the presidential race if convicted of any of the charges he faces.

At the time of that interview, Trump had just been indicted over his alleged mishandling of classified documents while out of office and had already been indicted in a New York hush money case that is going to trial on Monday.

Since then, Trump has been indicted two more times -- in a federal case related to Jan. 6 and a Georgia case over his alleged behavior while trying to overturn his 2020 defeat.

After repeated questioning by Stephanopoulos on ""This Week"" on Sunday, Sununu adjusted his response compared to his answer last year.

""Previously, you've said these charges are serious and Trump should drop out of the race if he's convicted. Do you still believe that?"" Stephanopoulos asked.

At first, Sununu said that Trump's legal issues were the very ""chaos"" that he had challenged during the GOP primary when he backed Haley.

When Stephanopoulos followed up again, Sununu said he no longer thinks Trump should end his campaign upon a conviction.

""No, no, no -- he's going to drop out after being the nominee? Of course, not. You know that's not to be expected at all,"" Sununu said.

""At the end of the day, they [people] want that culture change within the Republican Party. And if we have to have Trump as the standard-bearer -- and the voters decided that's what they wanted, not what I wanted ... If he's going to be the standard-bearer of that, we'll take it if we have to. That's how badly America wants a culture change,"" he said.

However, Sununu also said he ""100%"" still agrees with sharply worded criticism of Trump that he made days after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. At the time, Sununu said, ""President Trump's rhetoric and actions contributed to the insurrection.""

""His actions absolutely contributed to that,"" Sununu said on Sunday. ""There's no question about that. I hate the election denialism of 2020. Nobody wants to be talking about that in 2024. I think all of that was absolutely terrible.""

But he said that backing Trump, who continues to falsely claim he won the 2020 election, was about more than just Trump and argued that many Americans agree that ""change"" is needed in the federal government.

""Liberal elites in Washington want to stand on the shoulders of hardworking American families that built this country, defended this country and tell them how to live their lives. They're angry. They're upset. That's the culture change that people want to see,"" the governor said.

""People are upset by Jan. 6,"" he added. ""They're upset by the election denial. They have every right to be -- I am -- but at the end of the day, they need a culture change to get America back on track.""

Stephanopoulos pressed: ""Please explain, given the fact that you believe he contributed to an insurrection, how you can say we should have him back in the Oval Office?""

""For me, it's not solely about him; it's about maintaining a Republican administration, Republican secretaries and Republican rules that prioritize states' rights, individual rights and parents' rights,"" Sununu said.

""We're going to have a pro-business economy. We're not going to have a cancel culture that has really infiltrated all across America. It's not about Trump with me,"" Sununu insisted.

Sununu cited Trump's continued, widespread support among Republicans and early polling that shows him sometimes beating President Joe Biden in the general election, though Sununu exaggerated how high Trump's numbers usually are, according to polls tracked by 538.

""They're not crazy. They're not MAGA conservatives. They're not extremists. They want culture change,"" Sununu said.

""I'm not talking about polls,"" Stephanopoulos pressed. ""I'm asking you a very simple question. ... You believe that a president who contributed to an insurrection should be president again?""

Sununu answered: ""As does 51% of America, George.""

He went on to say that ""it's about understanding inflation is crushing families. It's understanding that this border issue is not a Texas issue. It's a 50-state issue, right, that has to be brought under control. It's about that type of elitism that the average American is just sick and tired of.""

Meanwhile, Sununu contended that Trump's pending trials have become akin to reality TV for ""the average American.""

While he's previously said he believes the New York case is political (which prosecutors deny), Sununu said last year that the classified documents charges against Trump were ""obviously very severe"" and ""self-inflicted"" and similarly called the federal election case against Trump ""extremely severe.""

Stephanopoulos pushed for an answer: ""You're comfortable with the idea of supporting someone who's convicted of a federal crime as president?""

""No -- I don't think any American is comfortable with any of this, they don't like any of this, of course,"" Sununu said.

Despite polling also showing that many voters would be turned off by Trump being convicted of a felony, Sununu emphasized his view that ""right now this is about an election.""

""This is about politics. That's what people are judging this on,"" he said. ""And the ultimate decision will be in November to see where people stand.""","

Trump's ""hush money"" trial gets underway today. Here's what to know.
By Graham Kates, Katrina Kaufman

Updated on: April 15, 2024 / 9:08 AM EDT / CBS News


The historic criminal trial of former President Donald Trump is poised to kick off in a Manhattan courtroom Monday, when he will become the first former president in U.S. history to stand trial.

The proceedings before Judge Juan Merchan are set to move forward after Trump made multiple attempts to delay them, resulting in a string of losses that failed to derail the trial's start.

The prosecution by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg stems from allegations Trump made a ""hush money"" payment to an adult film star in an effort to conceal damaging information about him during the 2016 election. 

It is the first of four criminal cases involving the former president to go to trial and comes as Trump is making a bid to return to the White House for a second term. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges he faces and claims the prosecutions are politically motivated.

Here's what to know about the case as jury selection gets underway on Monday:

What is the case about, and what is Trump charged with?

At the heart of this case is a payment made days before Trump was elected president in 2016. His attorney at the time, Michael Cohen, paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair, which Trump denies.

Prosecutors say Cohen was then reimbursed by Trump in a series of 12 monthly payments from the Trump Organization that were logged and characterized as checks for ongoing legal services, as opposed to repayments for the hush money. Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and has pleaded not guilty.

Justice Juan Merchan will explain the case to potential jurors with these words, according to a court filing:

""The allegations are, in substance, that Donald Trump falsified business records to conceal an agreement with others to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election. Specifically, it is alleged that Donald Trump made or caused false business records to hide the true nature of payments made to Michael Cohen, by characterizing them as payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a retainer agreement. The People allege that in fact, the payments were intended to reimburse Michael Cohen for money he paid to Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, in the weeks before the presidential election to prevent her from publicly revealing details about a past sexual encounter with Donald Trump.""

The trial formally kicks off on Monday with jury selection. More than 500 Manhattan residents have been summoned to appear as potential jurors in the trial. They will be asked to fill out a form with questions ranging from the mundane — what jobs they hold — to the more pointed, like whether they follow Trump on social media.

What do prosecutors say about the case?
Bragg said after Trump was arraigned in April 2023 that the core of the case is that Trump ""repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal crimes that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election.""

In a December radio interview, Bragg said the case is about ""conspiring to corrupt a presidential election and then lying in New York business records to cover it up.""

What has Trump said about the case?
Trump has repeatedly accused Bragg of pursuing the case for political gain, and has sought to tie the case to a broader accusation — without proof — that his political enemies have conspired to use the courts against him. He has also raged against Merchan, whom he has similarly accused of bias.

In a social media post on Wednesday, Trump made many of his typical unfounded claims about the case, including that it's ""an illegal attack on a Political Opponent,"" and that he will be ""forced to sit, GAGGED, before a HIGHLY CONFLICTED & CORRUPT JUDGE, whose hatred for me has no bounds.""

Trump will be ""gagged""? 
Well, not literally. But he is under a gag order limiting what he can say about the trial.

On March 26, Trump was barred from commenting on potential witnesses in the case, prospective jurors, court staff, lawyers in Bragg's office and the relatives of any counsel or court staffer — but was free to attack Bragg and Merchan.

Trump lashed out at the judge, and in the ensuing days focused on Merchan's adult daughter, who works for a consulting firm that works with Democratic candidates and causes. On April 1, Merchan expanded his gag order to prevent Trump from making more public comments about the judge's family. Merchan wrote that he had potential jurors and their families in mind.

""The average observer must now, after hearing [Trump's] recent attacks, draw the conclusion that if they become involved in these proceedings, even tangentially, they should worry not only for themselves, but their loved ones,"" Merchan wrote. ""Such concerns will undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitutes a direct attack on the Rule of Law itself.""

Will the trial be live-streamed?
No, there will be no live footage or audio from the courtroom, since New York state law prohibits broadcasting criminal proceedings. Photographers will be allowed to capture images at the start of each day of the trial. 

CBS News will have reporters covering the trial from the courtroom itself and from an overflow room on the same floor in the courthouse, where there will be a live feed.

Trump is represented by Todd Blanche, Susan Necheles and Emil Bove, among others. Blanche is also leading Trump's defense in two unrelated federal criminal cases. Necheles has been an attorney in Trump's orbit for years, and represented his company during a 2022 trial in which two of its entities were forced to pay a fine after being convicted of 17 felony counts related to tax fraud committed by executives.

Where is the trial?
The trial is taking place at the Manhattan Criminal Court, the same courthouse that has been used for eight decades to process cases for thousands of New Yorkers who each year come into contact with the criminal justice system.

Will Trump attend the trial?
Yes. Defendants in New York criminal cases are required to attend trials unless they apply for a waiver from proceedings. Trump has not done so.

Will Trump testify?
Trump told reporters after a March 25 hearing that he ""would have no problem testifying,"" but his lawyers have not said if they intend to call him. Pretrial filings in the case indicate the two sides have sparred over what topics prosecutors would be allowed to broach if Trump does take the stand.

How long will the trial last?
Court personnel and lawyers from both sides have said they expect the trial to last between six and eight weeks. Proceedings will generally be held four days a week, on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, with exceptions for holidays.

The prosecution will present its case first, followed by the defense.

If Trump is convicted, can he be sentenced to prison?
Yes. Each of the counts against Trump carries a maximum sentence of four years incarceration. Trump would be a first-time, nonviolent offender. The judge would have wide discretion in imposing a sentence, and could even give Trump no prison time at all.","WASHINGTON — Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley will join the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C., as its next Walter P. Stern Chair, according to a press release.

“Nikki is a proven, effective leader on both foreign and domestic policy,” Hudson President and CEO John P. Walters said in the release. “In an era of worldwide political upheaval, she has remained a steadfast defender of freedom and an effective advocate for American security and prosperity. We are honored to have her join the Hudson team.”

Haley’s new move comes after she dropped out of the Republican primary in March following a crushing defeat on Super Tuesday against former President Donald Trump. She campaigned on a moderate agenda compared to her rivals, which earned her the support of a wide range of voters.

Haley also consistently utilized her experience as the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in debates and at campaign events. She served in that role from 2017 to 2018 under the Trump administration, where she advocated for strong Israel-U.S. relations and helped lead the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.

Other renowned members have also joined the Hudson think tank. For instance, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao joined the group in 2021.","Television host Bill Maher admitted abortion ""kind of is murder"" but added he was OK with that.

Maher, during a panel discussion Friday on his HBO show ""Real Time,"" discussed abortion rights in light of former President Donald Trump saying that the issue should be decided by each U.S. state and not by a national ban.

""A lot of people think it's murder. That's why I don't understand the 15-week thing, or Trump's plan is, Let's leave it to the states. You mean, so killing babies is OK in some states?'"" Maher asked, DailyMail.com reported.

""I can respect the absolutist position. I really can. I scold the left when they say, 'Oh, you know what? They just hate women, people who aren’t pro-choice.' They don't hate women. They just made that up.""

Maher then said something that silenced his audience.

""They think it's murder, and it kind of is. I'm just OK with that,"" he said. ""I am. I mean, there's 8 billion people in the world. I'm sorry, we won't miss you. That's my position on it.""

The Catholic League's Bill Donohue said Maher is not the first, only the latest, abortion defender to admit the procedure's ""victims are innocent children.""

""Maher’s sincerity is appreciated, if not his promotion of violence,"" Donohue wrote. ""He knows, as every honest person who agrees with science knows, that abortion is the taking of innocent human life.

""The most famous person to warn of overpopulation, Thomas Malthus, was opposed to abortion as a remedy. Perhaps that’s because he was an Anglican minister. Maher is an atheist.""

British journalists Piers Morgan and Gillian Tett joined Maher in the discussion.

""They admitted they are fans of abortion rights, but when Maher said he was OK with the killing of innocent kids, they branded his position ‘quite harsh,'"" Donohue wrote about Morgan and Tett. ""They did not explain what was harsh about it.""

Trump last week said Democrats are the ""radicals on abortion."" He did so in a Truth Social post in which he provided video of former Virginia Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam being asked about a 2019 bill that sought to ease restrictions for third-trimester abortions in the state.

""If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen,"" Trump wrote that Northam said in the video. ""'The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.’

""In other words, the Baby would be executed after birth! ALWAYS REMEMBER — THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE RADICALS ON ABORTION."""
"Donald Trump has added something to the practice of extracting money from major donors: fear.

Traditionally, high-dollar contributors write big checks for a mix of reasons: to curry favor, to support their political party, to promote an agenda, to win favorable tax and regulatory policies, to defeat the opposition, to be seen as powerful — a blend of self-interest and principle.

This year, Trump’s history in the White House and the agenda for 2025 that he and his allies have been putting together amount to a warning to wavering supporters.

According to The Washington Post, Trump has candidly warned onlookers that he will turn the federal bureaucracy into an instrument to punish those who fail to toe the MAGA line:

He wants the Justice Department to investigate onetime officials and allies who have become critical of his time in office, including his former chief of staff, John F. Kelly, and former attorney general William P. Barr, as well as his ex-attorney Ty Cobb and former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. Mark A. Milley, according to people who have talked to him, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. Trump has also talked of prosecuting officials at the F.B.I. and Justice Department, a person familiar with the matter said.

In public, Trump has vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to “go after” President Biden and his family.

The events described in the Post story

reflect Trump’s determination to harness the power of the presidency to exact revenge on those who have challenged or criticized him if he returns to the White House. The former president has frequently threatened to take punitive steps against his perceived enemies, arguing that doing so would be justified by the current prosecutions against him. Trump has claimed without evidence that the criminal charges he is facing — a total of 88 across four state and federal indictments — were made up to damage him politically.

Trump has made retribution a central theme of his campaign, seeking to intertwine his legal defense with a call for payback against perceived slights and offenses to “forgotten” Americans.

Faced with the prospect of a chief executive prepared to abandon the rule of law for the rule of revenge, many affluent donors — for whom the machinations of government can determine bankruptcy or wealth — seem to think they have little choice but to pony up to the self-proclaimed “dictator for one day.”

Trump’s campaign to reclaim the White House — armed with the bristling Heritage Foundation playbook, which conservatives are using as a tool to pressure Trump to remain true to the hard-right agenda, as well as long, revealing lists compiled by Axios and The Times of prospective MAGA appointees — is the embodiment of the politics of intimidation.

How so?

At the core of what Trump and Heritage’s Project 2025 have proposed is an escalation of the power concentrated in the presidency and in the executive branch generally. This includes the politicization of the bureaucracy, whose mission would become, in part, to wreak revenge on Trump’s adversaries and the adoption, throughout federal departments and agencies, of policies rewarding ideological supporters and defunding ideological opponents.

Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor at Princeton of sociology and international affairs, summed up in an email the Trump-driven changes in the politics of raising money: “Most business leaders unfamiliar with autocratic government believe that when they support someone running for office, that person will owe them something if elected, tax cuts, deregulation, whatever the business leaders want.”

But, Scheppele continued, “autocrats turn the tables. Once elected, autocrats use the power of the state to squeeze business.”

Project 2025, Scheppele wrote,

is a blueprint for autocracy. In fact, it’s a direct copy of the plan that Viktor Orban used to take over the Hungarian government in 2010. If it is carried out, Project 2025 will concentrate huge power in the hands of the president, giving him the power to control the whole federal government at his whim. If business leaders think that this will benefit them and that giving up the rule of law is good for business, they will quickly learn that they are wrong. But it will be too late.

The Trump campaign has made it clear that Trump is not committed to adopting all the policy and personnel proposals described in Project 2025 or other documents produced outside his campaign.

At the same time, nowhere is corporate acquiescence to Trump more evident than among Republican megadonors who swore after Jan. 6, 2021, that they would never again support Trump but who are now swallowing their pride, trickling back in obeisance to the leader who betrayed them with his encouragement of the insurrection.

In February 2023, Eric Levine, one of the founders of the law firm Eiseman Levine and a prominent Republican fund-raiser, told Politico:

I don’t think it is fair to call Donald Trump a damaged candidate. He is a metastasizing cancer who if he is not stopped is going to destroy the party. Donald Trump is a loser. He is the first president since Hoover to lose the House, the Senate and the presidency in a single term.

As if that were not enough, Levine continued, Trump “is probably the only Republican in the country, if not the only person in the country, who can’t beat Joe Biden.”

Less than a month ago, however, Levine sent a memo to fellow Republicans telling them he had had a change of heart:

The adage of “never say never” is a wise one. I repeatedly said, since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, that I will never vote for Donald Trump. Today, however, due to a dramatic change in circumstances, albeit reluctantly and with reservations, I have decided I will vote for Trump in November.

Levine is not alone in his return to the Trump fold. On March 29, Josh Dawsey, Jeff Stein, Michael Scherer and Elizabeth Dwoskin, reporters for The Washington Post, published “Many G.O.P. Billionaires Balked at Jan. 6. They’re Coming Back to Trump.”

“As hopes of a Republican alternative have crumbled,” the four Post reporters wrote, “elite donors who once balked at Trump’s fueling of the Capitol insurrection, worried about his legal problems and decried what they saw as his chaotic presidency are rediscovering their affinity for the former president — even as he praises and vows to free Jan. 6 defendants, promises mass deportations and faces 88 felony charges.”

Some examples:

The day after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, billionaire and G.O.P. megadonor Nelson Peltz called the insurrection a “disgrace” and expressed remorse for voting for Donald Trump: “I’m sorry I did that.” In early March, nonetheless, Peltz hosted a breakfast meeting at his Palm Beach mansion with Trump and such billionaire Trump backers as Steve Wynn and Isaac Perlmutter.

And similarly, “After Jan. 6, billionaire developer Robert Bigelow said Trump had ‘lost me as a supporter. … He showed that, in that particular hour, he was no commander.’” This year, “Bigelow has pledged $20 million to a pro-Trump campaign group and has given $1 million to cover the former president’s legal costs.”

Bigelow was on the host committee for a record-setting $50.5 million fund-raiser for Trump and the Republican National Committee in Palm Beach on Saturday night. The suggested price of admission: $250,000 to $814,600.

Most of the commentary on the megadonors’ return to the Trump fold suggests that self-interest and greed are the primary motivators. In describing donors’ calculations, The Washington Post wrote: “The financial upside of going with the former president may win out. Trump has discussed further cutting the corporate tax rate, and he toyed in his administration with unilaterally lowering the capital gains rate paid by investors.”

Jonathan Chait, a columnist at New York magazine, is more explicit:

Joe Biden is running on a plan to increase taxes on the very wealthy, while Trump is promising to cut those taxes. In 2025, most of the Trump tax cuts will expire, as will Obamacare subsidies extended by the Inflation Reduction Act. The 2024 elections will therefore determine whether hundreds of billions of dollars remain in the pockets of wealthy people or instead fund things like health insurance for the middle class.

Similarly, Chris Cillizza wrote in his Substack newsletter, “I will now explain to you how these wealthy people overcame their principled stances against Trump as a threat to democracy.”

How?

The answer to all of your questions is money. Most rich people want to stay as rich as possible. Or get even richer. That is their main focus. So, when rubber meets road, that is their default setting. Principles go out the window.

The Post writers, Chait and Cillizza are right, up to a point. The about-face of these superrich donors is a mixture of greed and terror — terror of sparking the anger of a volatile politician who proudly declares, “I am your retribution.”

Just as Trump has cowed congressional Republicans — many of whom privately voice strong criticism of him — with the threat of MAGA-driven primary challenges, he has turned himself and his agenda into weapons of intimidation for businesses seeking to survive and thrive in a second Trump administration.

A primary goal of business is predictability, if not certainty, based in part on consistent rules, regulations and laws so that corporations can make plans and investments without worrying about arbitrary government interventions based on the revenge-seeking whims of a leader many see as a malignant narcissist.

American businesses are fully aware of Trump’s willingness to govern by caprice, a modus operandi he demonstrated repeatedly during his term in the White House.

In those years, however, he was held back by his own ineptitude, the incompetence of his most loyal advisers and the interventions of his more reasonable aides and key civil servants — a combination that kept him largely in check.

Catherine Rampell summed up some of the most egregious initiatives of the Trump White House in a November 2023 Washington Post column, “Take Trump at His Word When He Threatens to Punish His Enemies”:

Trump also frequently deployed economic and regulatory powers against businesses deemed insufficiently loyal.

For example, his administration launched a bogus antitrust investigation into some auto companies when they did not support his rollback of fuel-efficiency standards. He likewise reportedly instructed his top economic aide to interfere with the merger of AT&T and Time Warner, as punishment for critical coverage from CNN, which was then owned by Time Warner.

Trump also openly mused about revoking the licenses of broadcast news outlets for, among other things, reporting that his secretary of state had called him a “moron.” Again, his underlings did not go along with him.

Elsewhere, he tried to use the government procurement process to damage Amazon. According to a memoir by a top aide to then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Trump “called and directed Mattis to ‘screw Amazon’ by locking them out of a chance to bid” on a defense contract.

Trump’s allies, especially those working on Project 2025, are working tirelessly to make sure that if Trump wins in November, he will not be restrained by aides or career civil servants and that instead of taking office unprepared, he will have a complete MAGA agenda from Day 1.

Separately from the report, Project 2025 has been assembling names of Trump loyalists who will take his commands seriously — and not deep-six them — to fill key spots in a second Trump administration and assembling an across-the-board agenda of legislative initiatives, executive orders and regulatory changes running the gamut from anti-abortion policies to a strategy “to bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will,” in the words of one of the project’s authors.

Perhaps most important, Project 2025 asserts that “President Trump’s Schedule F proposal regarding accountability in hiring must be reinstituted.”

Schedule F, which Trump sought to initiate by executive order in 2020, would turn the top 50,000 or so civil servants, who are currently protected from arbitrary firing or demotion, into political appointees under the control of his administration. Trump lost the White House before Schedule F could be applied, and Biden withdrew the executive order creating it.

For corporate America, application of Schedule F would radically escalate uncertainty. Federal officials making decisions ranging from penalties for failed occupational safety violations to initiation of antitrust proceedings, from I.R.S. rulings to the application of sanitary regulations in nursing homes would presumably have to prioritize loyalty to Trump to keep their jobs.

Fear of the consequences of Schedule F is the strongest weapon of intimidation in Trump’s fund-raising armament. A significant campaign contribution might well serve as a useful shield.

“One practical consequence of undermining the civil service is a rise in cronyism,” Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow in governance studies at Brookings, wrote by email in response to my inquiry. “Usually we think of that in terms of the winners, the insiders getting special deals, but it is equally true that cronyism creates losers, the business elites that do not get favors or face punishment for their lack of loyalty to the ruling party.”

Trump and others on the American right, Williamson wrote,

have become enamored of Hungary’s Viktor Orban in recent years, and his regime provides a good example of how cronyism can be used to consolidate political power — not just in terms of the punitive use of regulations but in licensing and government contracting as well. Whether Trump would be able to achieve these kinds of results is deeply debatable, of course. But the model is there.

Elaborating on this theme, Jasper Theodor Kauth, a political scientist at Nuffield College, Oxford, wrote by email: “Trump’s threats to use state coercion to go after perceived personal and political opponents is evidence of his agenda to disrupt democratic norms.”

Kauth noted that he and Desmond King, a political scientist at Oxford, described these practices as “disruptive illiberalism” in their 2021 paper “Illiberalism”:

They keep up the appearance of honoring democratic procedures (elections) while eroding democracy through the back door — although in the case of Trump this erosion is now taking place in plain sight. These warnings need to be taken seriously regardless of their intention as they heighten the risk of a future transition to authoritarianism.

What drives the willingness of wealthy executives to abandon their principled concerns over Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 insurrection?

Rawi Abdelal, a professor of international management at Harvard Business School, argued that “fear and, frankly, naïveté are far more powerful influences than simple greed.”

Abdelal wrote by email:

What is most interesting to me is that this is not as much about Donald J. Trump, the individual, but about a moment in history. These sorts of antisystemic challenges to democratic practice are emerging across the developed world and in developing countries as well. There exists in these societies — including ours — a deep frustration with the system. Many believe that the system is simply unfair, and often it is exactly that.

Bruce Cain, a political scientist at Stanford, noted that some of the conservative victories in campaign-finance law have had the unintended consequence of strengthening “the power of elected officials to coerce donations out of the donors.”

There has always been, Cain wrote by email, “an element of hostile dependency built into campaign fund-raising. Businesses have always given money to gain access or avoid bad things happening to them if the people in power feel that certain supporters let them down.”

Until recently, Cain argued, the potential for extortion

was limited by stricter campaign contribution laws before we loosened the system up post the Citizens United decision. The irony of inviting large donors and businesses to give large or unlimited donations is that the court strengthened the implicit hostile dependency relationship between donors and Trump.

Republican donors sought the elimination of restrictions on donors in the belief that such loosening of the law “would favor them,” Cain wrote. Instead, “the dog has caught the car just as it is backing up on it,” adding: “Trump’s mafia m.o. can be counted on to take this to the extreme.”

While greed and fear are powerful motivations behind the decision to make campaign contributions to a candidate, they are not antithetical. Rather, they reinforce each other, something Trump appears to be acutely aware of.

Samuel Issacharoff, a professor of constitutional law at N.Y.U., described this dynamic in an email to me, which I will leave as the last word:

Trump governs in a swirl of corruption and intimidation. Everyone knows this and understands that in such regimes, proximity to power is key to government largess. In oligarchic regimes we see this in the sheer population concentrations in the capital city. Here, aspirants flock to Mar-a-Lago.

Stable democracies rely on institutions. Fragile democracies have poorly formed institutions. Unfortunately, the new populist wave sees the unwinding of institutions in favor of personalist rule. One cannot afford to be distant from the heart of power when perks are doled out on a one-by-one basis by cronies of the top commander of the country.

The rush to Trump does not, in my view, represent policy agreements with the Trump tax cuts or anything of the like. Many of those rushing to Trump actually had their taxes go up because of his retaliation against blue states through the elimination of the local tax property deduction. They are eager to contribute, and to be seen as contributing, because power and privilege flow from proximity. Trump may view himself as a latter-day Louis XIV, including in his love of gilt. But in more recent times, this is the governance style of the banana republic dictators of the 20th century and the populist antidemocrats of the 21st.","Texas A&M University responded to a state law banning diversity, equity and inclusion on college campuses by giving the department head a raise before reassigning her and other employees to other departments. It sparked concerns schools are attempting to further ""embed"" the controversial practice at Texas universities despite the law.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a law banning DEI on college campuses in June 2023. In the months that followed, documents obtained by Fox News Digital show Texas A&M reassigned several DEI employees to other departments, including the vice president of the program, who received a 10% raise, a new position and a nine-month paid leave.

A document obtained through a FOIA request showed that, in August 2023, Annie McGowan, vice president for diversity, was given ""a 5% salary increase in recognition of your performance"" and ""to address equity issues you will receive an additional 5%.""

The post-DEI bill moves have raised concerns that universities in Texas are reshuffling DEI officials while still encouraging them to continue their efforts through other positions.

TEXAS UNIVERSITY TAKES HEAT FOR CLEARING DEI OFFICES: 'THE CRUELTY IS STUNNING'

""The leadership at Texas A&M are doubling down on their fealty to DEI ideology instead of directing resources to programs that promote academic excellence,"" Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, chairman of Do No Harm, told Fox News Digital.

""Giving the former DEI head a raise explicitly on the basis of so-called equity and redistributing staff in the disbanded DEI department to other administrative jobs is an attempt to embed DEI into every department, blatantly ignoring the Texas law passed to ban such practices. This ideology is corrosive to the mission of and trust in our institutions of higher education. It must end."" 

Texas A&M has suggested since the passage of the bill it is still focused on incorporating DEI principles through its faculty.

""Just to be clear, at Texas A&M, we will continue to maintain a welcoming environment for all, and we will continue to appreciate, respect and harness the unique perspectives each of you bring to this institution,"" Texas A&M President Mark A. Welsh wrote in September 2023.

""Diversity of thought is a cornerstone of great universities, and, quite frankly, it’s a key ingredient to our continued success. Implementation of S.B. 17 will not change that.""

Several other universities have indicated they continue promoting DEI principles despite the law, The Federalist reported earlier this year.

Texas universities began laying off employees from DEI departments in response to the bill, and Republican State Sen. Brandon Creighton, who wrote the bill, recently warned state colleges should take the legislation ""very seriously"" and not try to skirt it with sneaky workarounds or they will face financial penalties.

""I have extraordinary concerns that universities in Texas are doing everything they can to skirt our new law and continue promoting leftist divisive DEI at the taxpayers' expense but just under a new name,"" Republican Texas State Rep. Brian Harrison told Fox News Digital. 

A Texas A&M University spokesperson told Fox News Digital 5% of the raise for McGowan was a ""standard merit increase for her work over the previous year"" and the other 5% was ""a salary adjustment granted by the former president to ensure fairness and parity relative to her peers within the school where she teaches."" The spokesperson said the pay bumps were not related to DEI practices.

The spokesperson added the university is ""dedicated to upholding the law. Last year, we implemented a comprehensive framework of measures and protocols to ensure we meet those legal obligations effectively and responsibility.

""We appreciate the opportunity to clarify this misconception because it is not accurate whatsoever,"" the spokesperson said. ""Texas A&M is following the new laws. DEI-related job duties have been eliminated across the university. As we continue to evolve and adapt to meet the needs of our student body, our commitment to academic excellence at Texas A&M will remain at the forefront of everything we do.

""Texas A&M’s Office for Diversity had eight positions, all of which were eliminated, along with programs and initiatives prior to Jan. 1, 2024, which is when S.B. 17 went into effect,"" the spokesperson continued. ""The university was able to identify open positions that aligned with each person’s skill set. Six of the eight took A&M up on the offer to move into a new job on campus, while the other two decided to leave.


""A couple dozen positions university-wide carried varying DEI-related responsibilities, with none exceeding 25% of their overall duties. The Human Resources & Organizational Effectiveness group collaborated with supervisors to remove all DEI-related duties and create new responsibilities for those employees.""

Harrison told Fox News Digital Republican lawmakers in Texas are working to make sure universities are not able to skirt the anti-DEI law.

""We have all these leftist Marxist professors, and I want to get rid of them,"" Harrison told Fox News Digital. ""Because I don't want my constituents being forced to pay for that. If anyone wants to go study this leftist garbage, they can do that. But my constituents are not going to pay for that, over my dead body.""","For President Joe Biden, an attack on Israel launched from Iranian soil amounts to a scenario he’d greatly sought to avoid since the start of the current Middle East conflict.

The reprisals heighten the risk of a wider regional conflict that could directly draw in the United States, along with other countries.

And they place Biden — again — in the tenuous position of pledging stalwart support for Israel while also trying to prevent a new conflagration from exploding with the United States involved.

What comes next is unknown. In the immediate aftermath of Iran’s attacks, American officials acknowledged they were entering uncharted territory. One significant question mark is how proxies might potentially join Iranian efforts to target Israel and add a new layer of unpredictability. And with Israel’s plans for a response still being formed, Biden administration officials are expected to continue advising their Israeli counterparts – with the desire for containment in mind.

In a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday night, in which Biden told Netanyahu to consider Saturday a win because the US assessed Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful and demonstrated Israel’s superior military capability, Biden made clear that the US will not participate in any offensive operations against Iran in response, a senior administration official told CNN.

But in the hours following Iran’s attack, it became clear the president faces a severe challenge putting a lid on the flare-up between Iran and Israel and stopping a full-scale regional war breaking out.

Israel will respond to Iran’s attack, but the scope of that response has yet to be determined, an Israeli official told CNN’s Jeremy Diamond on Sunday.

The official said Israel is yet to determine whether to try to “break all the dishes” or do something more measured.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned that the confrontation with Iran is “not over yet.” The country’s response options are expected to be discussed in detail during a meeting of Israel’s war cabinet meeting on Sunday.

The Commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Hossein Salami warned that Tehran would respond directly if Israel retaliates saying a “new equation” had been created.

Biden is also operating within the fraught politics of an election year, lending outsized importance to his upcoming decisions. The eruption of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7 has hurt Biden at home, eroding his support with key constituencies as he has declined to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

One of the reasons Biden returned urgently to the White House from his beach house in Delaware Saturday afternoon was the ongoing nature of the attack, one official said, with the Situation Room better equipped for real-time monitoring of events.

Administration officials saw Iran’s attacks on Israel Saturday as disproportionate to Israel’s strikes in Damascus that prompted the retaliation, a US official told CNN.

That view has been an important factor in the discussions taking place in the White House throughout the day on next steps, particularly as Biden is set on preventing a full-scale regional conflict from erupting.

There is also a recognition that what Israel is likely to do in response will depend on a full damage assessment, including potential casualties, so the Biden administration’s advice to Israel will depend on that picture coming into focus, the official added.

In the immediate aftermath of the Israeli strikes in Syria that killed top Iranian commanders, US officials monitored Iran gearing up to launch a major attack on Israel, seeing it as inevitable. As the US, in close consultation with Israel, sought to figure out exactly how, when and where exactly Iran would retaliate, administration officials never fully ruled out Iran trying to strike inside Israel as well as American personnel and assets in the region.

The most likely “worst case scenario,” one senior administration official said in the days leading up to Iran’s Saturday attacks, was a direct attack by Iran on Israel, and the eruption of a state-on-state conflict that could very well prompt the beginning of a wider regional conflict that the US has been working to prevent since the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ October 7 attacks.

Despite his current tensions with Netanyahu over the war in Gaza, Biden and his top officials have sought over the past week to diminish any daylight between the US and Israel when it comes to Israel’s defense against Iran.

In the hours before Iran launched its attack, the US defense secretary and national security adviser spoke with their counterparts in Israel to reiterate that support. And last week, Gen. Erik Kurilla, the commander of US Central Command, was in Israel discussing contingencies with officials ahead of the expected attack.

Biden kept to his Friday promise that “the US is devoted to the defense of Israel,” with defense officials telling CNN that the US military successfully intercepted some Iranian missiles on Saturday.

Contained within the conversations about preparations for Iran’s attack and coordinating a response were also implicit encouragement to the Israeli government to not allow the situation to spiral out of control if Iran’s response was limited in nature, officials familiar with the matter said.

The US also sent messages publicly and privately to Iran warning about escalating the crisis further and pressed European and Arab allies to use their own leverage with Tehran to deliver similar messages.

As Iran’s plans to attack Israel grew clearer, American officials increasingly assessed that Tehran was not seeking direct conflict with the United States. Ahead of the drone attack launched by Iran on Saturday, US officials said they did not expect the targets to include American forces in the region.

That is a change from earlier in the conflict, when Iran-backed militias regularly attacked US troops in the Middle East, including in a strike that killed three Americans stationed in Jordan. After the US launched retaliatory strikes, the attacks by Iranian proxies waned.

Yet the simmering tensions between Iran and Israel have not let up. Without any direct channels of communication between the two countries, the risk of miscalculation is amplified.
","n 2022, Republican candidate Kari Lake, who was vying to be governor, called abortion the “ultimate sin” and praised a 160-year-old Arizona measure that virtually outlawed abortion as “a great law.”

In 2024, Lake, now vying to be a U.S. senator, has evolved in her stance. After the Arizona state Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that the 1864 law can be revived, Lake said the decision was “out of step with Arizonans.”

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.
Lake, a former television news anchor who narrowly lost her 2022 gubernatorial race to Katie Hobbs (D), has been striking a different tone on reproductive rights as the issue shapes up to be an animating force this election cycle. The spotlight has been strong on Arizona since the court ruled that the near-total ban, which was enacted even before Arizona became a state, can be enforced.

The ruling, which is not yet in effect, would outlaw the procedure except to save a pregnant person’s life. Health-care providers who perform abortions could be punished with prison time, though Arizona’s attorney general, Democrat Kris Mayes, has vowed not to enforce any ban. The decision has sent shock waves throughout the battleground state and could jeopardize Republican hopes of picking up a seat in the U.S. Senate. Lake is expected to face Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in the November general election.

Since Tuesday’s ruling, Lake has called on Hobbs and the GOP-led state legislature to come together on a solution. In a 5½-minute campaign video released Thursday, Lake sought to appeal to the majority of the state, saying the near-total abortion ban — which invokes an 1864 law that states that anyone who administers an abortion could face a mandatory prison sentence of two years to five years — is “out of line with where the people of this state are.”

In the video, Lake declared that if elected to the Senate, she would not support federal funding for abortions nor would she support a federal abortion ban. She expressed support for abortion exceptions in the case of rape, incest or threat to the life of the pregnant person, and also noted that she wants other those who are pregnant to have “more choices” — but did not get into specifics.

“I chose life, but I’m not every woman. I want to make sure that every woman who finds herself pregnant has more choices so that she can make that choice that I made,” she said.

Along with outlining her position on abortion, Lake also expressed her support for what she called a “baby bonus” — providing tax incentives for individuals who get married and lowering their tax rate for each child born. Throughout the video, Lake repeatedly associated her stance on the abortion issue with former president Donald Trump — who continues to poll ahead of President Biden in Arizona.

When asked for comment, Lake’s campaign referred The Washington Post to the video posted Thursday.

Trump has found himself having to shift on abortion, especially this election cycle. Just a day before the Arizona ruling came out, Trump said states should make their own decisions about regulating abortion. But then he criticized the Arizona court for reinstating an abortion law he said goes too far.

Lake was also among a long list of GOP politicians who had declared that they believe life begins at conception.

But ever since Roe v. Wade was overturned nationally two years ago, Arizona has been confronted with how to change its laws. Since December 2022, the state has allowed doctors to provide abortions up to 15 weeks into a pregnancy, with exceptions for medical emergencies.

Then came an Alabama Supreme Court ruling in February that declared that frozen embryos should be considered children, prompting many providers of in vitro fertilization to temporarily halt the procedure as they weighed the consequences of the decision. The Alabama ruling prompted many Republicans — including Lake and members of Congress who had signed on to legislation declaring that life begins at conception — to express their support for in vitro fertilization.

Now Arizona voters are poised to consider whether to amend the state’s constitution to enshrine abortion rights in November. Polls show that a majority of Arizona voters want abortion to be legal and many say it’s an issue that motivates their voting decision.

An October New York Times-Siena College poll found that 59 percent of Arizona registered voters said abortion should be mostly or always legal; 34 percent said it should be mostly or always illegal. In a Fox News poll from March, 39 percent of Arizona voters said abortion would be extremely important in deciding their vote for president, and 32 percent said it would be very important. Those who supported Biden in 2020 were nearly twice as likely to say the issue would be extremely important in their vote, 51 percent to 27 percent.

Arizona’s ruling — and Republicans’s response to it — have again highlighted the electoral challenge the GOP faces over their party’s record on abortion and reproductive rights.

So far, access to abortion in the post-Roe era has been a winning stance for Democrats, and ballot measures to expand abortion access have been successful, even in Republican-dominated states. At the same time, Republicans like Lake are finding they have had to revisit what they’ve said about the issue in the past.

During a Republican gubernatorial debate in 2022, when Lake expressed support for the 1864 law, she added that abortion pills should be illegal and said she believes life begins at conception.

“My personal belief is that all life matters. All life counts, and all life is precious, and I don’t believe in abortion,” she said then. “I think the older law is going to take and is going to go into effect. That’s what I believe will happen.”

Lake also told “The Conservative Circus with James T. Harris” in a radio interview in 2022 that she supported a law that prohibits abortions with exceptions to save the life of the mother.

“I’m incredibly thrilled that we are going to have a great law that’s already on the books,” Lake said, adding that “it will prohibit abortion in Arizona except to save the life of a mother. And I think we’re going to be paving the way and setting course for other states to follow.”

Lake, who remains the front-runner ahead of the state’s GOP primary this summer, will then probably face off against Gallego, a member of Congress from Phoenix. He and other Democrats are seizing the opportunity to attack her shifting comments on the issue.

Speaking to reporters before appearing alongside Vice President Harris at a campaign rally in Tucson on Friday, Gallego seized on the importance of abortion rights to voters, saying abortion access was “the number one political issue” in Arizona.

Gallego and Harris both blamed Trump for what’s happening in Arizona, connecting the new near-total abortion ban to Trump’s appointment of conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices who ultimately overturned Roe in 2022.

“The overturning of Roe was, without any question, a seismic event — and this ban here in Arizona is one of the biggest aftershocks yet,” Harris said.

Lake may also be losing some of her core supporters and antiabortion activists as she struggles for a more moderate message. Steve Deace, an Iowa-based conservative talk show host, wrote on X this week that he was “extremely disappointed” by Lake’s opposition to the ruling. “In 2022, I thought Kari Lake was one of the best candidates I’ve ever seen, and said so. Now she is almost completely unrecognizable from the candidate she was then, just two years later,” he wrote.

Kim Owens, who has long been involved with the Arizona Republican Party, also said she was disappointed by Lake’s recent statements.

“If you are pro-life and you’re looking at the landscape and you recognize that this is something we’ve been fighting for decades and that the fight continues, in Arizona we’re faced with a ballot proposition that is an abomination,” Owens said.

Owens, who supports Lake’s GOP primary competitor in the Senate race Mark Lamb, a sheriff, said she thinks Lake is “trying to go outside of her base” to attract more voters.

“I think she understands that she does not have the allure she once did. She’s seen the numbers. Mark Lamb is picking up a lot of support from party faithful, and she’s afraid she’s going to lose her base,” she said.

Election 2024","Multiple new polls show Joe Biden strengthening slightly in the US presidential election, but suggest third-party candidates could present a risk to his chance of carrying the White House in November.

According to a New York Times/Siena College poll released on Saturday, Biden has whittled down the four-point lead Donald Trump held in February, with Trump leading Biden 46% to 45% among registered voters.

The narrowing of support for the candidates seven months before election day comes as Trump is likely to be largely off the campaign and fundraising trail for the next six weeks while he attends a criminal trial in New York over pre-2016 election hush money payments.

Despite the narrowing of Trump’s lead that the New York Times poll found, the survey located a worrying issue for Democrats: some voters recalled Trump’s 2016-20 presidency, despite his capacity to sow divisiveness and chaos, as a time of economic prosperity and strong national security.

Before 2020 election, only 39% of voters said that the country was better off after Trump took office – a figure that has risen in the intervening years with a Democrat in the White House.

According to the New York Times, 42% now view Trump’s term as better for the country than the Biden administration, compared with 25% who say the opposite and an additional 25% saying Biden has been “mostly bad” for the country.

Approval of Trump’s handling of the economy was also up 10% over the past four years.

A separate study of 1,265 registered voters released on Sunday by I&I/Tipp showed Biden at 43% and Trump at 40% if no other choices are in the mix.

Poll respondents were asked who they preferred in a two-candidate contest, with the option to chose “other” and “not sure” – options that both returned 9% of those polled. That 18% figure of the total vote, editor Terry Jones of Issues & Insights wrote, showed that Biden and Trump “are not opposing against one another in a vacuum”.

Asked a follow-up question that added the independent candidates Robert F Kennedy Jr, an environmental lawyer and vaccine sceptic, the Harvard professor Cornel West, and the Green party figure Jill Stein, Biden took the greater hit to his support, leveling with Trump at 38%.

With Kennedy at 11%, West at 2%, and Stein at 1%, Jones calculated that Kennedy’s presence siphoned off five points of Biden’s support to Trump’s two.

“This is not surprising, given that RFK Jr is on most issues a traditional progressive leftist, which makes him indistinguishable from the current leadership of the Democratic party,” Jones wrote.

According to the Kennedy campaign, the candidate and vice-presidential pick Nicole Shanahan currently have enough signatures to get on the ballots of just six states: Hawaii, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, North Carolina and New Hampshire.

Earlier this month, third-party group No Labels announced it would not field a “unity ticket” candidate after reaching out to 30 potential people and raising $60m despite assessing that “Americans remain more open to an independent presidential run and hungrier for unifying national leadership than ever before”.

The group said it would only offer a candidate if it could identify a candidate with a “credible path” to the White House.

“No such candidates emerged, so the responsible course of action is for us to stand down,” it said.

Kennedy, who has consistently denied his candidacy is in effect a “spoiler” to Democratic hopes of retaining the White House, is not the only worry for the party currently holding executive power.

Polls are wildly conflicting. A recent Rasmussen survey found that Biden trails Trump regardless of third-party candidates.

In a two-way contest between Biden and Trump, 49% of likely US voters said they would choose Trump, and 41% would vote for Biden. That was a marginal increase for Trump since February, when he led by six points.

That same poll found 8% would vote for some other candidate, virtually matching the I&I/Tipp findings.","When House Speaker Mike Johnson appeared at Mar-a-Lago on Friday alongside Donald Trump, it was widely understood that both men had something to gain. The beleaguered GOP congressional leader, for example, is facing intensifying criticism from his far-right flank — including a motion-to-vacate effort launched by one of his most radical members — and receiving the former president’s imprimatur will likely give the Louisianan a boost.

As for the presumptive Republican nominee, Friday’s meeting helped his ego — Trump appears to like it when officials make the trip to Florida to kiss his ring — and his conspiracy theories. A Politico report noted last week that the former president benefits from having “the country’s highest-ranking Republican ... lend credence to his voting concerns.”

It was against this backdrop that NBC News reported:

Former President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson pitched new legislation to crack down on noncitizen voting on Friday, despite the fact the practice is already illegal and occurs rarely. Johnson said House Republicans would introduce a bill to require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote, speaking at Mar-a-Lago next to Trump as he seeks to fend off threats from his right flank.

For now, let’s put aside the fact that it’s utterly ridiculous for two election deniers to pretend they’re deeply concerned with the integrity of elections. Instead, let’s emphasize three of the glaring problems with the Trump/Johnson pitch.

The first is that the Republican leaders are pushing a solution to a problem that does not exist. There are literally zero locations in the United States where non-citizens can vote in federal and/or state elections. For that matter, you’re more likely to find Americans struck by lightening than non-Americans trying to cast ballots.

As NBC News’ report added, “Many have investigated noncitizen voting and found little evidence of it.”

The Brennan Center found just 30 suspected noncitizen votes amid 23.5 million votes in 2016, suggesting that suspected noncitizen votes accounted for 0.0001% of votes cast. Trump’s own election integrity commission disbanded without releasing evidence of voter fraud, even though he’d claimed 3 million undocumented immigrants had voted in 2016 costing him the popular vote.

The second problem is the redundancy. “It seems like common sense, I’m sure all of us would agree that we only want U.S. citizens to vote in U.S. elections,” the House speaker told reporters on Friday.

After Iran’s strikes, Biden pitches a ‘take the win’ line with Israel
But what he neglected to mention is that because this is “common sense,” it’s already illegal for non-citizens to vote in U.S. elections. There’s simply no point in passing a federal law to prohibit something that’s already prohibited under federal law.

All of which leads to the third problem: the motivation behind the GOP leaders’ push.

Johnson said Friday that a recent influx of immigrants is “one of their designs” that Democratic officials created “because they want to turn these people into voters.” That’s absurd for all sorts of reasons, including the years-long process in which some of these immigrants might be able to become citizens.

As a Washington Post analysis concluded last week, “As generally formulated, the ‘great replacement theory’ posits that the intent is to grant these new arrivals citizenship, allowing them to vote legally. But that takes too long to be useful for November, so here we are. Is all of this entirely cynical, simply a political ploy? It’s hard to see how it might not be.”

","ABC News is among a unified grouping of the five chief broadcast and cable news networks, along with major wire, print and radio organizations, that have penned an open letter asking presidential candidates to publicly commit to taking part in televised debates ahead of the general election.

In addition to ABC News, the letter is signed by CBS News, CNN, NBCUniversal News Group and FOX News Media, along with The Associated Press, C-SPAN, NewsNation, Noticias Univision (Univision Network News), NPR, PBS NewsHour and USA TODAY.

""With the contours of the 2024 general election now coming into clear focus, we -- the undersigned national news organizations -- urge the presumptive presidential nominees to publicly commit to participating in general election debates before November's election,"" the letter, published on Sunday, reads.

This unusual move comes amid an election cycle during which the practice of debates, a decades-old American campaign tradition, has been met with uncertainty from both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.

Trump, who skipped all four Republican National Committee-sanctioned 2024 primary election debates and pulled out of one of his three debates with Biden in 2020, has enthusiastically urged Biden to participate in the three general debates scheduled for this fall -- a position echoed by his campaign again on Sunday.

""President Trump has been very clear: he is willing to debate Joe Biden any time, any where, any place. We once again call on Joe Biden to commit to debates,"" spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said.

The Biden campaign has expressed concern with the organization of these debates by the Commission on Presidential Debates, signaling that the nonpartisan group that has sponsored the events since the 1980s has been unclear about their ability to administer a ""fair"" debate with Trump.

In April 2022, the Republican National Committee also voted unanimously to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates.

The Biden campaign declined to comment on the new letter but the president has previously played down Trump's eagerness to get on stage with him.

""Well if I were him I'd want to debate me, too. He's got nothing else to do,"" Biden told reporters in February.

""General election debates have a rich tradition in our American democracy, having played a vital role in every presidential election of the past 50 years, dating to 1976. In each of those elections, tens of millions have tuned in to watch the candidates debating side by side, in a competition of ideas for the votes of American citizens,"" the media organizations urged in their letter.

""If there is one thing Americans can agree on during this polarized time, it is that the stakes of this election are exceptionally high. Amidst that backdrop, there is simply no substitute for the candidates debating with each other, and before the American people, their visions for the future of our nation,"" the letter concludes.

Biden has mostly avoided commenting publicly on engaging in debate with Trump. Asked following his State of the Union address in March if he would commit to one, Biden remarked to ABC News: ""It depends on his behavior.""

The Democratic National Committee, which has thrown all of its support behind Biden, did not hold any primary election debates this cycle despite the urging of his long shot challengers. There is no precedent for an incumbent president to have participated in a primary debate, however, since the first modern debate was held in 1948-- even when presented with high-profile primary opponents.

Trump's campaign is still lobbying hard for general election debates against Biden. On Thursday, the former president's senior campaign advisers sent a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates calling for ""much earlier"" and ""more"" presidential debates than initially proposed, saying voting is beginning ""earlier and earlier.""

""Voting is beginning earlier and earlier, and as we saw in 2020, tens of millions of Americans had already voted by the time of the first debate,"" top Trump campaign advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita wrote in the letter.

""Specific to the Commission's proposed 2024 calendar, it simply comes too late,"" they wrote, listing estimates of how many votes Americans will have likely voted by current proposed dates.

The two claimed Americans were ""robbed of a true and robust"" debate in 2020 because the debate commission accepted the Biden campaign's wish amid the coronavirus pandemic.

In 2020, there were only two debates involving Biden and Trump. A third scheduled debate was canceled after the former president backed out because it was moved from being an in-person to virtual event because of COVID-19.

Trump then attacked the commission, claiming he would not accept any of their changes intended to enforce the rules and limit interruptions at the remaining presidential debates.

The RNC's vote in 2022 to pull back from comission-sanctioned debates mandated that candidates pledge not to participate in them. The national party has not revised its position.

The commission has announced it plans to hold the first debate on Sep. 16 at Texas State University, the second on Oct. 1 at Virginia State University and the third on Oct. 9 at The University of Utah, Salt Lake City. It plans to hold a vice presidential debate on Sept. 25 at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania.","The first criminal trial of a former president in U.S. history is officially underway in a crowded Manhattan courtroom, where prosecutors and defense attorneys are beginning the arduous task of seating a 12-person jury in the case of The People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump.

Flanked by his attorneys in room 1530 of the Manhattan Criminal Court, Trump is seated at a table where countless defendants before him have appeared. Monday's proceedings began with lawyers for both sides arguing over several aspects of the case, including what evidence should be admissible and what questions should be asked of potential jurors.

The first 96 out of several hundred New York residents who make up the jury pool were sworn in just after 2 p.m., formally marking the beginning of the historic trial. More than half were quickly dismissed after they said they could not be fair and impartial. A handful of others were dismissed after saying they could not serve for reasons that were not disclosed.

Trump is charged with 34 state counts of falsifying business records related to a ""hush money"" payment his attorney made to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, claiming the prosecution is part of a plot by Democrats aimed at preventing him from retaking the White House. The case is the first of the four criminal prosecutions against Trump to make it to trial.

The presumptive Republican nominee for president addressed reporters outside the courtroom before making his way inside.

""This is really an attack on a political opponent. That's all it is,"" Trump said. ""So I'm very honored to be here.""

Judge Juan Merchan took his seat on the bench just before 10 a.m. and called the proceedings to order. He quickly denied a motion from Trump's legal team asking him to recuse himself from the case. Trump's attorneys had argued that Merchan should step aside because of his daughter's employment at a consultancy firm that does work for Democratic candidates and progressive groups. Merchan said their argument relied upon ""a series of inferences, innuendos and unsupported allegations.""

Trump's lawyers and prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office argued over a handful of outstanding issues related to evidence, rules for the trial and the questions that potential jurors will answer.

Joshua Steinglass, a member of Bragg's team, said the prosecution would offer evidence that Trump conspired with his former attorney Michael Cohen and an executive at the parent company of the National Enquirer to suppress damaging stories about Trump, and publish negative stories about his rivals, before the 2016 election.

Steinglass said David Pecker, then the CEO of American Media, Inc., would testify that Pecker that ""he ran these stories to bolster Mr. Trump's campaign"" and that they were ""shown to Mr Trump before they were published, so he could approve, suggest or reject changes."" Steinglass said prosecutors would introduce evidence pointing to ""a deal struck between the defendant and AMI to put their thumbs on the scale."" 

Todd Blanche, an attorney for Trump, said the evidence has ""nothing to do with the charged crime."" Merchan soon said he would allow prosecutors to use the evidence at trial.

Merchan also said he would allow evidence related to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who also alleged an affair with Trump and sold the rights to her story to the National Enquirer.

Other rulings went in the defense's favor. Merchan reiterated a previous decision that the infamous Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump can be heard talking about grabbing women, would not be played for the jury. He also disallowed a tape of Trump discussing the tape during an unrelated deposition.

Later, prosecutors indicated they would ask the judge why Trump shouldn't be held in contempt for apparent violations of a gag order that Merchan imposed weeks ago. The order limits what Trump can say publicly about many of those involved in the case, including potential witnesses. Trump has attacked two well-known key witnesses in the case, Cohen and Daniels, in social media posts since Merchan issued his order. Prosecutors asked the judge to hand down a fine of $1,000 each for three Trump posts and order that they be taken down. Merchan said he would hear arguments over the issue next week.

At several points during the arguments, Trump appeared to fall asleep at the defense table, his chin appearing to drop to his chest briefly. In one instance, He was stirred awake by his attorney, Blanche, who touched his shoulder and spoke to him.

Once the final pretrial questions were resolved, 96 of the more than 500 members of the jury pool were escorted into the room. Roughly 200 were present at the courthouse. 

Merchan began by laying out the allegations against Trump, namely that he ""falsified business records to conceal an agreement with others to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election."" He continued by mentioning Cohen and Daniels.

""Specifically, it is alleged that Donald Trump made or caused false business records to hide the true nature of payments made to Michael Cohen, by characterizing them as payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a retainer agreement,"" Merchan said. ""The [prosecutors] allege that in fact, the payments were intended to reimburse Michael Cohen for money he paid to Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, in the weeks before the presidential election to prevent her from publicly revealing details about a past sexual encounter with Donald Trump.""

The roughly three dozen potential jurors who were not dismissed are being asked to respond to 42 additional questions ranging from the mundane — what jobs they hold — to the more pointed, like whether they follow Trump on social media. Some will then be called in for individual questioning. Trump's lawyers and prosecutors will seek to whittle the group of potential jurors down to just 12, plus half a dozen alternates, in a process that is expected to take at least a week, and likely longer. 

Once jury selection is over, the two sides will then begin presenting their cases, with the prosecution going first.

As a criminal defendant, Trump is required to attend proceedings each day of the trial unless he applies for and is granted a waiver. Court personnel and lawyers from both sides have said they expect the trial to last between six and eight weeks. 

Merchan reminded Trump that he must be in court every day of the trial, and issued a standard warning given to all criminal defendants that he will be subject to arrest if he fails to show up.","Donald Trump did not look chagrined as he prepared to walk into a New York courtroom and become the first former president in American history to be tried after being accused of a crime.

""This is an assault on America,"" he told reporters gathered in a hallway, calling the charges ""nonsense"" and ""an outrage"" and repeating his unfounded assertion that President Joe Biden was behind his prosecution on 34 counts of violating New York State law.

""This is really an attack on a political opponent, that's all it is,"" Trump said as a police dog barked in the background. ""So I'm very honored to be here.""

Never before has a former president faced criminal charges. Never before has a presumptive presidential nominee been compelled to spend at least four days a week sitting in a courtroom − and with a gag order limiting his attacks on those involved in his prosecution on social media. And never before has a national candidate taken what would have otherwise been a death blow and embraced it as a political asset.

Of course, Trump already made a scowling mug shot taken at the Fulton County Jail for other criminal charges an iconic image, now plastered on T-shirts and coffee mugs, flags and posters and digital trading cards.

Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide

He has been running against Biden more or less continuously since 2020, when they faced off in an election that Trump lost but never conceded. But in some ways the 2024 general election campaign began Monday at 100 Centre Street in lower Manhattan, chronicled by a half-dozen ""pool"" reporters and a sketch artist sitting on the benches in the 15th-floor courtroom.

With the Republican and Democratic nominations now settled, this trial may be the best chance of upending a contest that is tight as a tick.

The question for voters: Is Trump unfit for the presidency if he is convicted of falsifying business records to cover up hush money he paid to a porn star − all in an attempt to deep-six a political embarrassment during the last campaign?

Or is he the unfair victim of a politically motivated prosecution on charges he denies and deems unimportant?

Former U.S. President Donald Trump sits with his attorney Todd Blanche before Justice Juan Merchan at the beginning of his trial over charges that he falsified business records to conceal money paid to silence porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016, in Manhattan state court in New York City, U.S. April 15, 2024, in this courtroom sketch.
Oh, yes. It's a legal question, too
Those are the same questions that will face the dozen jurors and six alternates being selected over the next week or so, with consequences more personal for Trump than those in his last two trials.

A federal defamation trial brought by E. Jean Carroll and a civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James carried the threat of financial penalties − enormous ones, as it turned out − but not prison time.

In the new case, the People of the State of New York against Donald J. Trump, each of the 34 Class E felonies carries a maximum sentence of four years, although many legal experts find the prospect of an extended incarceration for the former president unfathomable.

Political consequences loom, too.

The allegations, some of them legal and some personal, that have swirled around Trump for years haven't shaken his core support. Even those relating to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol have galvanized his political support and made it politically unwise for his GOP rivals for the nomination to attack him.

Now the most recent national polls averaged by realclearpolitics.com finds a contest that is essentially tied: Trump at 45.6%, Biden at 45.4%.

Could this trial roil a race even though views of both major contenders seem set in concrete?

Maybe.

In a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll last month, 44% of those surveyed said they planned to follow Trump's trial in New York, though the effect a conviction could have on their vote seemed small.

Among Trump voters, 84% said they would still vote for him if he was convicted in this trial or others. Among those who would change their vote, 8% would support a third-party candidate, and less than 1% − in other words, just two of the 336 Trump voters surveyed− said they would switch to Biden.

That said, in a very close contest even a small switch in support, or the decision by some voters to stay home, can have a crucial impact.

Campaigning from a basement and the Rose Garden
It's hard to miss the campaign trappings of the trial.

Trump arrived in his signature garb: a blue suit, red tie and white shirt, with an American flag pin on his lapel.

Before he left Trump Tower in the morning, he posted a series of attacks on the social media site Truth Social attacking Justice Juan Merchan as ""Crooked,"" the gag order as ""Unconstitutional"" and his prosecution as ""Election interference.""

He blasted out one fundraising email, then and another in his name as he sat in the courtroom. ""They're just a DEEP STATE plot from RADICAL Democrats to come after you − and I'm the only thing standing in their way!"" he warned.

In previous elections, by choice or necessity, presidential contenders have campaigned in venues other than rallies and speeches and debates.

Eugene V. Debs, nominated by the Socialist Party of America, received close to 1 million votes in 1920 when he campaigned from prison, where he was incarcerated on charges of sedition; he promised to pardon himself if elected. That year's election was won by Warren G. Harding, who campaigned mostly from his front porch, a technique used by other candidates of that era.

Biden used a version of that in 2020, not from his front porch but from his basement in Delaware because of the COVID-19 pandemic. President Gerald Ford and other modern incumbents have run Rose Garden campaigns, staying close to the White House and emphasizing the trappings of incumbency.

But a courtroom campaign?

We have never been here before.","Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., reportedly is releasing a video that heaps blame on Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for the southern border crisis amid the latest push for an impeachment trial.

The Daily Caller first obtained a copy of the video containing news clips on the massive migrant influx, Mayorkas' insistence he's trying to protect the border, and Marshall's criticism of the inaction.

""Secretary Mayorkas is complicit in aiding and abetting [President] Joe Biden’s historic border invasion,"" Marshall told the outlet ahead of the Monday video release.

""He has failed to uphold his oath of office and compromised the safety and security of every American. Right now, the cartel has more control of the border than Alejandro Mayorkas; he isn’t just derelict in his duties, he’s complicit in endangering the safety and security of every single American.

""The Democrats are so afraid of the political backlash a trial would have on the 2024 elections that they are abandoning their responsibility and undermining our Constitution to take unprecedented measures to block Sec. Mayorkas’ impeachment trial,"" Marshall charged.

But, he warned, ""make no mistake: Come November, 'we the people' will speak loudly.""

""The American people will not forget the betrayal,"" he told the outlet. ""[Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer [D-N.Y.] and his radical caucus are very clearly worried about the next election and not the national security threat our wide-open borders pose to the sovereignty of our nation.""

Marshall also warned ""if Senate Democrats skirt their responsibility"" and block an impeachment trial, ""we should hold them accountable at the ballot box.""

""The people of Montana, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Nevada must make their voices heard,"" he said about the battleground states.

Only the House of Representatives has the power of impeachment. The Senate tries impeachments.

Marshall has been focused on Mayorkas for months, and in January, introduced a no-confidence resolution.

On Monday, Marshall alleged Mayorkas lied several times before Congress under oath — and asserted the secretary doesn't have ""operational control"" of the U.S. border, The Daily Caller reported. 

Mayorkas in late January pushed back against the accusations being made against him in articles of impeachment, saying that the claims being made against him are ""baseless.""

""I will defer a discussion of the constitutionality of your current effort to the many respected scholars and experts across the political spectrum who already have opined it is contrary to law,"" Mayorkas said in a seven-page letter to the House Homeland Security Committee.

""What I will not defer to others is a response to the politically motivated accusations and personal attacks you have made against me.""

"There are almost daily headlines now describing what Donald Trump would do if elected: the mass deportations, the pardons handed out to his friends and golf buddies, the Justice Department settling scores and waging personal vendettas. The former president has even promised violence if the election goes against him, warning that it could be a “blood bath.”

But as worrying as these prospects are, they are far from the biggest threats he poses. What we should fear most is Mr. Trump transforming our government into a modern-day Tammany Hall, installing a kleptocratic leadership that will be difficult if not impossible to dislodge.

I do not discount the possibility of state-sponsored violence, and I worry deeply about the politicization of the civil service. But those are, for the most part, threats and theories, and while they need to be taken seriously, people should be paying more attention to a far more likely reality: that Mr. Trump would spend much of his time in office enriching himself. He failed spectacularly as an insurrectionist and as a disrupter of the civil service, and his clownish and chaotic style may well lead to failure again — but he has succeeded time and time again in the art of the steal. If his grift continues into a second term, it will not only contribute to the fraying trust Americans have in their institutions, but also impair our ability to lead the world through a series of escalating crises.

Recall how Mr. Trump operated in his first term. Not only did he keep his stake in more than a hundred businesses, he made it a practice to visit his properties around the country, forcing taxpayers to pay for rooms and amenities at Trump hotels for the Secret Service and other staff members who accompanied him — money that went straight into his bank accounts and those of his business partners. Those interested in currying favor with the president, from foreign governments to would-be government contractors, knew to spend money at his hotels and golf clubs. According to internal Trump hotel documents, T-Mobile executives spent over $195,000 at the Trump Washington Hotel after announcing a planned merger with Sprint in April 2018. Two years later, the merger was approved.

Government, like fish, rots from the head down. Mr. Trump’s example freed up cabinet members to award huge contracts to their friends, business associates and political allies, while others ran their departments like personal fiefs. After the State Department’s inspector general was fired, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s use of official trips for clandestine meetings with conservative donors and allegations that his family misused staff members for tasks like walking his dog, picking up his wife from the airport and fetching his takeout came to light. And, in addition to being accused of improperly accepting gifts from those seeking influence, several other cabinet members were alleged to have used government funds for private travel. These may seem like banal infractions, but taken together, they are a reflection of who Mr. Trump is and how he governs.

Throughout his life, through Trump-branded wine, chocolate bars, sneakers, NFTs, ties, MAGA paraphernalia, a $59.99 Bible (of all things) and, most recently, his Truth Social meme stock ploy, he has shown an unstoppable drive to enrich himself at all costs. He sees politics, like business, as a zero-sum game in which he wins only if someone else loses. These are the instincts that drive corruption, kleptocracy and grift. And, if past is prologue, we’re looking at a much more damaging sequel.

In a second term, Mr. Trump will have more freedom and power to undertake grift. He has already vowed to use pardons to protect supporters and possibly even himself from efforts to curb corruption (which may explain the nonchalance with which his son-in-law Jared Kushner has greeted criticism about the conflicts of interest raised by his recent real estate investments in Serbia and Albania, as well as the Saudi, Qatari and Emirati investments in his wealth fund). And he and his political advisers are building a deep bench of committed and loyal employees who could corrode and potentially destroy mechanisms of accountability in government, paving the way for kleptocratic leaders to entrench themselves in the bureaucracy where many would be able to remain past Mr. Trump’s term. And the mere presence of a phalanx of unquestioning lieutenants in the civil service will ensure that other civil servants fear retribution for objecting to the self-enrichment.

Naturally, I worry about other things, too, particularly the possibility of political violence. Mr. Trump could well claim he has won the election no matter the vote count and call on his supporters to rise up to ensure his takeover. Even before the votes are cast, his supporters are threatening election officials, judicial officials and state legislators, trying to intimidate them into either helping Mr. Trump or stepping aside to be replaced by Trumpists.

But legal, law enforcement and security obstacles are still in place to slow down or stop these efforts. We must remember that this time around, President Biden will still be president, able to control the military and federal law enforcement, and Congress has amended the outdated and vague Electoral Count Act to make it much harder for Mr. Trump’s congressional allies to contest a Trump loss in the electoral college or on Capitol Hill.

No such guardrails exist to curb Trumpian corruption. The Supreme Court, itself corrupt, has made it virtually impossible to prosecute even the most blatant corruption by government officials.

In a kleptocracy, corruption is a feature, not a bug, where politicians apply the law inconsistently, favoring friends and punishing enemies. By controlling government assets and handing them out to friends and family — and dangling possibilities in front of would-be supporters — as well as using politically motivated prosecutions, kleptocrats cement their control of government and disempower opponents. We need only recall Russia’s erstwhile effort to create a democracy: It quickly drained away into the pockets of Vladimir Putin and his oligarchs, leading to the hopelessness and acquiescence of Russian citizens once they realized they could no longer change their situation through democratic means.

Now we face that danger at home. If Mr. Trump wins, America will have a leader invested in his own personal power, both financial and punitive, and supported by a much more capable team. When lucrative contracts are handed out to Trumpist loyalists regardless of merit and dissident voices are targeted and silenced, America’s leadership on the global stage will dissolve when it’s needed most.

The consequences will echo for generations if we lack the ability and the will to attack problems like climate change, mass migration, a new space race and multiple wars. Nothing of substance will be done, Mr. Trump’s cronies will continue to act with impunity, and millions of Americans — already worried that elites are held to a different standard than regular people are — will lose even more confidence in their government, convinced that everyone in Washington is out for himself.

This combination of passivity on the one hand and impunity on the other could be fatal for our democracy. This is the true danger Mr. Trump poses.","White House national security communications spokesperson John Kirby reacted to Iran's direct attacks against Israel, in part by blaming former President Trump for supposedly emboldening Iran. 

Kirby sat down with Shannon Bream on ""Fox News Sunday"" to discuss the latest escalation in the Middle East under the Biden administration. Israel fended off a furious attack of more than 300 drones and missiles launched at Israel from Iran on Saturday, thwarting 99% of the attack with the help of neighbors and allies such as the U.S.

The Biden administration has reportedly advised Israel against a retaliatory strike against Iran.

""The weakness that we've shown [under the Biden administration], it's unbelievable. And it would not have happened if we were in office, you know that,"" Trump said Saturday. 

Bream pressed Kirby about the Biden administration's policies to permit waivers on sanctions and unfreezing assets vis-à-vis Iran. Last month, the Biden administration re-approved a sanctions waiver to permit Iraq to purchase energy from Iran, effectively allowing the state-sponsor of terrorism to access $10 billion. Kirby had said at the time the money would not go to its ""mullahs.""

""Could this administration have been tougher on Iran? Did it sense an opening?"" Bream asked. 

""It's hard to take a look at what President Biden has done and say that we have somehow gone soft on Iran,"" Kirby responded. ""It was the previous administration that decided to get us out of the Iran deal. And now Iran is so much dramatically closer to a potential nuclear weapon capability than they were before Mr. Trump was elected.""

Biden warned Friday that an attack by Iran on Israel was possible over the weekend, telling reporters his message to the Islamic Republic was ""Don’t.""

GOP senators criticized what they saw as Biden's continued weakness on deterrence after the Iranian regime ignored his request. 

""So much for President Biden telling bad guys ‘Don’t’ actually being an effective deterrent. Every time he says ’Don’t,' they do,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., wrote in an X post on Saturday.

""Under President Trump, Iran was broke. President Biden gifted them billions of dollars and then naively said 'don’t,'"" said Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. ""'Don’t' is not a foreign policy. Joe Biden’s policies have funded Iran’s attack on Israel.""

Bream pressed Kirby again on whether the White House was soft on Iran, and he again blamed Trump's foreign policy. 

""Is it not fair to say, though, that there have been moves by this administration that have opened up cash and other opportunities for them, which we know are fungible in ways that are not helping the Iranian people but are benefiting the elites and people there who chant ‘Death to America?,'"" Bream asked.

Kirby responded by saying, ""The additional funds that have been made available to Iran due to the sanctions relief program that the Trump administration put in place, can only be used for humanitarian goods. It doesn't go to the regime. And the idea that the regime was somehow felt like they were freed up to support these proxies because of that. It just doesn't comport with the fact that they have been supporting these proxies for years.""

Fox News' Michael Lee, Brooke Singman and Caitlin McFall contributed to this report.","(CNN) — Retiring Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and former Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, are holding off on throwing support behind their parties’ presidential nominees, while taking aim at members on both sides of the aisle for stalled legislation in Congress.

When asked by CNN’s Manu Raju if Manchin and Portman would vote for President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, respectively, the two dodged the question but made clear that they will not be voting for the opposing party’s nominee.

While Portman said he’s “looking at the policies,” Manchin signaled that his hesitance over committing to vote for the president is because he believes Biden’s policies have become more progressive over the years.

“I know Joe Biden and I’ve known Joe Biden for a long time, and it’s not the Joe Biden I’m seeing today — the way he’s being pulled so far left by his administration,” Manchin told Raju on “Inside Politics Sunday.” “I want to see him take charge again, bring him back to the central, center part where they’re responsible, sensible, most of the people are.”

Manchin, a centrist who has long found himself at odds with members of his party and has been critical of the president for being too liberal, announced last year that he will not run for reelection — a blow for Democrats’ chances to hold control of the Senate. He briefly explored a third-party presidential run but announced earlier this year that he will not mount a 2024 campaign for president.

The Democratic senator also blamed Biden for the border crisis, adding that the president “has to take blame for what is wrong,” but Manchin and Portman agreed that some GOP members’ unwillingness to compromise and vote on a bipartisan border security bill has made the issue more dire.

“Whatever Joe Biden has done that was wrong and gets blamed for, it’s worse now that we know we can fix it and it’s done in a bipartisan way, and you won’t accept it,” Manchin said.

In early February, Senate Republicans blocked the bipartisan border deal, which included foreign aid for Ukraine and Israel, amid opposition from top House Republicans and Trump.

Portman echoed Manchin’s call for members of both parties to work on this issue and said he disagreed with the Republicans who walked away from the deal, which the former senator argued was not perfect but “a step in the right direction” and “incrementally good for the country.”

When asked by Raju if he believes Trump killed the deal because he wanted the issue, Portman said he thinks “that’s part of it” and added that it might have been a missed opportunity.

“I also think, though, that having not solved it through this process — let’s say President Trump is reelected, let’s say you do get a Republican Senate, I think it’s going to be very difficult to find 60 votes going forward,” Portman said. “I think this was the opportunity.”

Manchin and Portman also told Raju that they disagreed with Republicans’ move to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who in February became the first cabinet member to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The House is expected to send impeachment articles to the Senate this week, and Manchin has said he will vote to dismiss the articles. Portman said he doesn’t support the move because it could create a precedent.

“My problem with that impeachment is that if you were to impeach somebody for following the policy direction of the White House, rather than focusing on the White House, then you’re gonna have that happen again and again, tit-for-tat. Democrats impeach Republicans,” Portman said.

The two men also lamented the state of the current Congress, with Portman calling it “dysfunctional” and Manchin going as far as saying, “Every one of us should be ashamed of what we’re, what we’re living through now in the 118th Congress.”

Manchin and Portman — who have both been known to negotiate bipartisan agreements during their tenure — said they believe lawmakers aren’t as willing to compromise on significant legislation. Manchin added that he worries if the filibuster ends, which requires 60 votes to pass a measure, it will shrink the number of moderates in either party and make compromise more difficult.

“I am scared to death that whoever, on either side, is going to ever support getting rid of the filibuster, you will ruin that completely,” Manchin said. “You will not have a middle at all — it’ll be swinging from the left and the right. That’s not who America is.”

Portman said in his view, it’s less about whether a lawmaker is moderate but whether they are “willing to come to the middle to figure out how to solve problems.”

“And you can be MAGA Republican, you can be a progressive Democrat, but if you’re willing to look at your job as solving problems, then you figure out how to find common ground,” Portman said. “And that needs to be the overriding concern. I worry that that is in short supply in the Senate today.”

Jerry Dean McLain first bet on former president Donald Trump’s Truth Social two years ago, buying into the Trump company’s planned merger partner, Digital World Acquisition, at $90 a share. Over time, as the price changed, he kept buying, amassing hundreds of shares for $25,000 — pretty much his “whole nest egg,” he said.

That nest egg has lost about half its value in the past two weeks as Trump Media & Technology Group’s share price dropped from $66 after its public debut last month to $32 on Friday. But McLain, 71, who owns a tree-removal service outside Oklahoma City, said he’s not worried. If anything, he wants to buy more.

“I know good and well it’s in Trump’s hands, and he’s got plans,” he said. “I have no doubt it’s going to explode sometime.”

For shareholders like McLain, investing in Truth Social is less a business calculation than a statement of faith in the former president and the business traded under his initials, DJT.

Even the company’s plunging stock price — and the chance their investments could get mostly wiped out — doesn’t seem to have shaken that faith. The company has lost $3.5 billion in value since its public debut last month.

As a business, Trump Media has largely underwhelmed: The company lost $58 million last year on $4 million in revenue, less than the average Chick-fil-A franchise, even as it paid out millions in executive salaries, bonuses and stock.

And in two years, Truth Social has attracted a tiny fraction of the traffic other platforms see, according to estimates from the analytics firm Similarweb — one of the only ways to measure its performance, given that the company says it “does not currently, and may never, collect, monitor or report certain key operating metrics used by companies in similar industries.”

But for some Trump investors, the stock is a badge of honor — a way to show their devotion beyond buying Trump merchandise, visiting Trump golf courses or donating to Trump’s presidential campaign.


Trump Media stock's terrible week
1:36

Trump Media spokeswoman Shannon Devine said in a statement that “Truth Social has created a free-speech beachhead against Big Tech for a fraction of the start-up and operating costs that the legacy tech corporations incurred, while having no debt, more than $200 million in the bank, and the support of hundreds of thousands of retail investors who fervently believe in our mission.”

Trump Media has boasted that it has benefited from a flood of “retail investors” — small-time and amateur shareholders betting their personal cash. Its merger partner, Digital World Acquisition, said its shares were bought by nearly 400,000 retail investors, and Trump Media’s chief executive, Devin Nunes, told Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo on Sunday that the company had added over 200,000 new ones in the past couple of weeks.

“There’s not another company out there that has retail investors like this,” said Nunes, who this year will receive a $1 million salary, a $600,000 retention bonus and a stock package currently worth $3.7 million.

In an interview last month with conservative commentator Sean Hannity, the former Republican congressman recounted a recent discussion with Trump where the men celebrated having “opened up the internet and kept it open for the American people.”

“I’ll never forget the conversation we had,” Nunes said. “He said, ‘You know, once we’re all dead and gone, this will last forever.’”

Many of Truth Social’s investors say they’re in it for the long haul. Todd Schlanger, an interior designer at a furniture store in West Palm Beach who said Trump had been one of his customers, said he’s invested about $20,000 in total and is buying new shares every week.

Schlanger said he now watches his stock performance every day hoping for positive signs. In a Truth Social post last week, he encouraged “everyone who supports Donald Trump and Truth [Social to] buy a share everyday” and asked, “Do you think we have hit bottom?” (The stock slid nearly 10 percent after that post.)

He suspects the recent drops in share price have been the result of “stock manipulation” from an “organized effort” to make the company look bad. There’s no proof of such a campaign, but Schlanger is convinced. “It’s got to be political,” he said, from all the “liberals that are trying to knock it down.”

That range of emotions is on full display on Truth Social, where thousands of mostly anonymous accounts have flocked to meme-filled investor groups, one of which is emblazoned with a computer-generated image showing Trump pumping his fist on a Wall Street trading floor.

Some accounts there have recently encouraged traders to keep investing in a fight they said was about “good vs evil” — a way to defend Trump from the liberal elites laughing at him and, by extension, them. The user @BaldylocksUSMC said “the fight has been long and hard on most of us” and that “this stock is not for the weak,” but that one day they would triumph over critics who were “brainwashed beyond repair.”

After the billionaire media mogul Barry Diller called Trump Media a “scam” stock bought by “dopes,” one account, @Handbag72, claimed to have bought more shares, arguing Diller didn’t “get it” or was “at risk of [losing] $$$$.” The next day, the account shared a 2021 blog post from the investing forum Seeking Alpha saying Truth Social could be worth $1 trillion in the next 10 years.

But there are also flickers of uncertainty and disenchantment, with some saying they faced thousands of dollars in losses or had “risked [literally] everything.” One user who had posted “Tired of WINNING yet?” earlier this year when the stock spiked posted that this week’s losses were “painful to stomach.”

“Come on DJT, every time I buy more, the price drops more,” the user @bill7718 wrote. “When will it be the BOTTOM!!” (He posted a chart Thursday showing the stock rising slightly alongside the caption, “moving!!” The price has since gone back down.)

The user @manofpeace123, who said they bought shares at $65 and that 71 percent of their portfolio was DJT stock, said on Wednesday that investing was a way of telling Trump, “I believe in you and I stand with you through good times and bad.” But a day later, the user added: “can’t help but feel sad. … feel like I’m trying to catch a falling knife.”

Another account, @realJaneBLONDE, posted on Sunday that she was “NOT panicked NOT worried” before, two days later, posting a message to Trump and congressional Republicans urging them to make it “illegal” to bet against or short-sell stocks.

“Sick of MY investment money being stolen!!” she wrote. “They’re stealing peoples money and you’re allowing it!!”

Some users said they were “baffled” by the stock’s ups and downs, and one asked for advice on how to tell her husband she didn’t want to sell. One user posted a meme image saying, “If you’re worried about your Money, Remember This, DJT stock is about FREE SPEECH & Without FREE SPEECH Money won’t mean much.”

But other users saw such questions as displays of unacceptable doubt. When the user @seneca1950 asked whether anyone was concerned that the company’s upcoming plans to issue tens of millions more shares would sink the stock price, two accounts criticized the account for spreading “FUD” — fear, uncertainty and doubt.

“Are you a Fudster,” wrote a user named “Jesus Revolution 2024.” Wrote another, called Rabristol: “You must be short with no way out!”

In moments of apparent despair, some users work to lift one another up by arguing that they are enduring the same kinds of “deep state” attacks that had long shadowed Trump himself. When user @BingBlangBlaow said they were embarrassed to be so “deep in the red” and questioned why “everyone [was] acting like everything is fine,” Chad Nedohin, a Canadian investor and prominent cheerleader of the stock on Truth Social and the video site Rumble, responded, “No [one’s] fine with it, but we are DJT now. The deep state is making their run at Trump … and us.”

The user, however, posted afterward that the argument left him unconvinced. “I’m tired of blaming the deep state,” he said. Later, he added, “You would think that the ‘biggest political movement of all time’ would want to support the man leading it and get much better numbers than” this. (The accounts did not respond to messages and offered no way to contact them.)

Carol Swain, a prominent conservative commentator in Nashville who previously taught political science at Vanderbilt University, said she invested $1,000 in Trump Media stock earlier this month, at $48 a share, over the objections of her financial adviser, who predicted the stock would dive.

“If I lose it, fine. If I make a profit, wonderful. But at the end of the day, I wanted to show my support,” she said. “There’s such an effort to destroy him and strip his wealth away, and so much glee about it. I would like to see him be a winner.”

She, too, suspects stock manipulation, arguing that “the people who hate Donald Trump would do anything to try to hurt him.” As for Truth Social itself, she said she posts there only sparingly and prefers X, where she has 35 times as many followers. “I have always wanted not to just preach to the choir,” she said.

McLain, the tree service owner in Oklahoma, said he believes the stock could “go to $1,000 a share, easy,” once the media stops writing so negatively about it and the company works through its growing pains. The company’s leaders, he said, are being “too silent right now” amid questions about the falling share price, but he suspects it’s because they’re working on something amazing and new.


“This isn’t just another stock to me,” McLain said. “… I feel like it was God Almighty that put it in my lap.” (Nick Oxford for The Washington Post)
McLain is an amateur trader — he invested only once before and “lost [his] butt” — and said he hasn’t talked to his family about his investment, saying, “You know how that is.” But he believes the Trump Media deal is a sign he is “supposed to invest,” he said.

“This isn’t just another stock to me. … I feel like it was God Almighty that put it in my lap,” he said. “I’ve just got to hold on and let them do their job. If you go on emotion, you’ll get out of this thing the first time it goes down.”

Razzan Nakhlawi contributed to this report.","he missiles and drones that rained destruction on Israel in the early hours of Sunday morning have given Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, what he’s always craved – a mandate and justification for openly attacking Iran, a country he has long viewed as Israel’s archenemy and possible nemesis. The pressing question, which may be answered within hours, is what form Israel’s promised “significant response” will take – and whether Iran, in turn, will strike back again. “We will build a regional coalition and exact the price from Iran in the fashion and timing that is right for us,” said the Israeli minister Benny Gantz, as the Israeli war cabinet met to discuss Israel’s response today.

It is incumbent on the US, Britain and other friends and allies of Israel to inform Netanyahu in plain terms that continued military, diplomatic and political support is conditional on a legitimate and proportionate Israeli riposte. It would be preferable if Israel did not hit back at all. Iran failed in its apparent aim of inflicting serious harm. Israel says 99% of its missiles and drones were destroyed. Thankfully, casualties have been light. Tehran now says, a little hopefully, that the episode is “concluded” – but vows to fight back if attacked.

Netanyahu’s wisest course would be to hold up the attacks to the world as supposed incontrovertible proof of his hawkish view: that Iran is a malign, dangerous rogue state that flouts international law and imperils Israel, Arab and western states. Instead of blindly lashing out – for example, at Iran’s nuclear facilities – he should argue that the Islamic republic’s hardline leadership and its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have shown their true colours – and deserve collective, international punitive action.

On past form, it is unrealistic to expect Netanyahu to turn the other cheek. Tehran’s action has presented him with a unique opportunity to switch global attention away from his government’s appalling depredations in Gaza and his failure to defeat Hamas. He may say that the war against Hamas has been transformed into an existential war against its puppet masters in Tehran – and that people of goodwill, at home and abroad, must rally round his leadership to ensure a necessary victory.

The fact that Netanyahu and his inner war cabinet appear to have deliberately and recklessly provoked this showdown should not be forgotten as the crisis unfolds. Israel’s prime minister has been at the forefront of a decades-long shadow war of assassination and attrition against Iran. The covert, unacknowledged killing of its nuclear scientists and leaders of its regional proxy militias has become almost routine. But the target list has expanded since the 7 October atrocities.

In December, for example, Sayyed Razi Mousavi, a senior Iranian general, was killed in Damascus. Iran’s reaction, then as in the past, was relatively limited and indirect. But the 1 April bombing of an annexe of its embassy in the Syrian capital, which killed several senior commanders, radically changed this dynamic. Iran blamed Israel (which as usual has not admitted responsibility) for a direct, blatant assault on is sovereign territory. Israel, Khamenei said, had crossed a red line.

It’s hard not to agree. The war had come out of the shadows – and this was Netanyahu’s doing. He must have known how furious would be the reaction in Tehran. Tellingly, he did not inform his US ally in advance, probably because the administration would have tried to veto the operation. The Damascus embassy attack looks like a premeditated escalation designed to fortify Netanyahu’s domestic political position, silence criticism from the blind-sided Americans and deflect international pressure to halt arms supplies to Israel.

And it has worked. Overnight, the criticism in Washington of the Gaza debacle has dried up. In Britain, too, calls on the government to insist on an effective Gaza ceasefire and limit support for Israel’s coalition will now probably be drowned out. Instead, the UK is already involved militarily, in the air over Syria and Iraq, and could be drawn further in. More than that, the Damascus attack succeeded in flushing out Iran. No longer could Tehran’s leaders hide behind proxy forces such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Netanyahu had, in effect, called them out, as though in a duel. They plainly felt they had no choice but to respond in kind.

That belief was, and is, mistaken. Like Netanyahu, Khamenei and Iran’s hardline president, Ebrahim Raisi, had choices. It would have been smarter by far if Iran, faced with the embassy outrage, had taken its grievances to the UN and the international court in The Hague, and raised the issue through friends in the G20 and the Brics grouping. Iran could have threatened retaliation and then held back. In this way it could have won sympathy in the global south and from anti-western allies such as China and Russia.

Instead, Khamenei – a foolish reactionary with almost zero personal experience of the outside world – walked straight into the trap Netanyahu had set. Iran, in the eyes of most of the international community, has made itself an outlaw. And Iran’s people must await Israel’s response. Depending how bad that is, the deeply unpopular Islamic regime could face an upsurge in internal instability, even a popular uprising.

After Iran’s attack on Israel, further escalation must be stopped

This unprecedented, direct confrontation between Israel and Iran, building for years, has placed the US president, Joe Biden, in an all but impossible position. He came to office in 2021 hoping to revive the landmark 2015 US-European nuclear deal with Iran that Donald Trump idiotically scrapped. Now his policy lies in tatters. Biden finds himself on the brink of an escalating armed conflict with Iran, fighting alongside an Israeli government whose actions in Gaza he has belatedly but vehemently deplored, and which may cost him dear in November’s US election.

Biden cannot abandon Israel, even though he may believe Netanyahu has played him again (as he thinks was the case at the start of the war with Hamas). Yet he cannot plausibly ask American voters, long since out of patience with costly foreign entanglements, to support another Middle East war. Trump, Netanyahu’s buddy, must scarcely credit his luck.

All of this – Netanyahu’s cynical machinations, Tehran’s violent miscalculations, Biden’s stark dilemma – points in only one direction: the need for urgent, concerted international action to halt further fighting and prevent a Middle East-wide escalation sucking in Syria, Lebanon, and the Gulf and Red Sea regions. Of the parties to this conflict, no one country or leader is in the right. In fact all, to varying degrees, are in the wrong. All require saving from themselves. The alternative is more bloodshed, more endless, pointless, spreading misery.

The UN security council is due to meet in emergency session today. Instead of the usual wrangling, its permanent members, especially China and Russia, will need to work constructively together to defuse a crisis that threatens us all. Together they have the clout and the leverage to do it. They must use it – or suffer the dreadful, unknowable consequences.","Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s threat to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson has run up against a new obstacle: former President Donald Trump, who publicly defended Johnson against Greene’s attacks.

At a joint news conference at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, Trump praised Johnson’s job performance and appeared to try to soft-soap Greene into easing up on her pressure campaign.

“We’re getting along very well with the speaker, and I get along very well with Marjorie. We have a speaker who was voted in, and it was a complicated process. And I think very — it’s not an easy situation for any speaker,” Trump said.

“I think he’s doing a very good job, about as good as you’re going to do,” he said about Johnson. “I’m sure that Marjorie understands that. She’s a very good friend of mine and I know she has a lot of respect for the speaker.”


Setting aside the fact that Greene said Johnson was “full of s---” just hours before the two men’s joint appearance, Trump’s expression of confidence in Johnson is yet another blow to Greene’s efforts to browbeat the speaker into alignment with her agenda. Her threat to bring a motion to vacate has gained little to no traction among her fellow Republicans, who are still bruised and tired from last year’s chaotic speakership circus. And now the person to whom she has tied her entire political career is essentially telling her to back off.

This may well be the one and only time that Trump tries to mediate Greene and Johnson’s rocky relationship — after all, he currently has far more pressing matters to deal with. The former president is possibly the only figure in the party whom Greene will heed on the matter. Whether Trump’s comments are a sufficient deterrent against further attacks from Greene, only time will tell.","A top Democrat on Sunday slammed former President Donald Trump after he sought to clarify his view on abortion bans as a state issue and said the various local laws were working ""very brilliantly.""

""American women are not going to be conned by Donald Trump,"" Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith told ABC News ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos, adding, ""We know that he is the one who is responsible for what's going on.""

Abortion restrictions returned to the spotlight after the Arizona Supreme Court last week upheld a near-total abortion ban from the 1800s that only provides exceptions if the mother's life is at risk. The ruling was celebrated by abortion opponents but condemned by advocates for reproductive rights.

Trump said he thought the decision went too far and maintained that it ""will be taken care of"" by state lawmakers. Republican leaders in Arizona say they are weighing their options and what constituents want.

While Trump defended his states' rights position on abortion as weakening Democrats' political advantage on the issue, saying he ""totally killed"" it, Sen. Smith on ""This Week"" took another view. Trump has also often touted his role in ending Roe v. Wade's guarantees to nationwide abortion access, Smith noted.

""That is what has caused all of this chaos and cruelty,"" she said.

""He is responsible for these abortion bans,"" she said, ""and I think he's going to be held accountable for that come the election in November.""

Smith, who has also worked at Planned Parenthood, is backing a proposal that would repeal The Comstock Act, a 19th-century law that abortion opponents say can be used to limit the mailing of abortion medication. On ""This Week,"" Smith indicated that Comstock could be another front in the fight over the issue.

""We have to pay attention to this and make sure that we are doing everything that we can to protect people's rights to make their own decisions about their own bodies and their own lives,"" she said.

Pressed by Stephanopoulos about Trump's view and why it wasn't sufficient to her, Smith said women in various states now live with disparate rights.

She pointed back to Trump's comments last week that having states handle it individually is ""working the way it's supposed to.""

""We broke Roe v. Wade, and we did something that nobody thought was possible,"" Trump said then. ""We gave it back to the states. And the states are very working very brilliantly, in some cases conservative, in some cases not conservative.""

Smith responded on ""This Week"": ""Ask a woman in Arizona or Texas whether she thinks this is working for her. Because, for her, this isn't a political discussion. This is about her personal life and her decisions that she can make for herself about her own life.""

Currently, 14 states enforce bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, and two states -- Georgia and South Carolina -- don't allow abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy.

After the U.S. Supreme Court ruling against Roe in 2022 that undid a national right to abortion, Smith was one of more than 20 senators who called on President Joe Biden to use executive action to protect abortion rights.

On Sunday she lauded him for his support for abortion access but said the ultimate goal must be to elect more pro-abortion access lawmakers ""so that we can put the protections of Roe in law.""

In light of how potent abortion access now appears to voters, who have consistently sided with Democrats on the issue, Stephanopoulos asked Smith about general election polls persistently showing Trump tied or ahead of the incumbent president

What matters is the choice that people will make at the ballot in November, Smith maintained, adding that ""the [choices] couldn't be more clear.""

""You have Joe Biden and Kamala Harris who are fighting to protect people's freedom,"" she said, ""and Donald Trump who's responsible for taking it away.""","The first criminal trial of a former president in U.S. history is officially underway in a crowded Manhattan courtroom, where prosecutors and defense attorneys are beginning the arduous task of seating a 12-person jury in the case of The People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump.

Flanked by his attorneys in room 1530 of the Manhattan Criminal Court, Trump is seated at a table where countless defendants before him have appeared. Monday's proceedings began with lawyers for both sides arguing over several aspects of the case, including what evidence should be admissible and what questions should be asked of potential jurors.

The first 96 out of several hundred New York residents who make up the jury pool were sworn in just after 2 p.m., formally marking the beginning of the historic trial. More than half were quickly dismissed after they said they could not be fair and impartial. A handful of others were dismissed after saying they could not serve for reasons that were not disclosed.

Trump is charged with 34 state counts of falsifying business records related to a ""hush money"" payment his attorney made to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, claiming the prosecution is part of a plot by Democrats aimed at preventing him from retaking the White House. The case is the first of the four criminal prosecutions against Trump to make it to trial.

The presumptive Republican nominee for president addressed reporters outside the courtroom before making his way inside.

""This is really an attack on a political opponent. That's all it is,"" Trump said. ""So I'm very honored to be here.""

Judge Juan Merchan took his seat on the bench just before 10 a.m. and called the proceedings to order. He quickly denied a motion from Trump's legal team asking him to recuse himself from the case. Trump's attorneys had argued that Merchan should step aside because of his daughter's employment at a consultancy firm that does work for Democratic candidates and progressive groups. Merchan said their argument relied upon ""a series of inferences, innuendos and unsupported allegations.""

Trump's lawyers and prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office argued over a handful of outstanding issues related to evidence, rules for the trial and the questions that potential jurors will answer.

Joshua Steinglass, a member of Bragg's team, said the prosecution would offer evidence that Trump conspired with his former attorney Michael Cohen and an executive at the parent company of the National Enquirer to suppress damaging stories about Trump, and publish negative stories about his rivals, before the 2016 election.

Steinglass said David Pecker, then the CEO of American Media, Inc., would testify that Pecker that ""he ran these stories to bolster Mr. Trump's campaign"" and that they were ""shown to Mr Trump before they were published, so he could approve, suggest or reject changes."" Steinglass said prosecutors would introduce evidence pointing to ""a deal struck between the defendant and AMI to put their thumbs on the scale."" 

Todd Blanche, an attorney for Trump, said the evidence has ""nothing to do with the charged crime."" Merchan soon said he would allow prosecutors to use the evidence at trial.

Merchan also said he would allow evidence related to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who also alleged an affair with Trump and sold the rights to her story to the National Enquirer.

Other rulings went in the defense's favor. Merchan reiterated a previous decision that the infamous Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump can be heard talking about grabbing women, would not be played for the jury. He also disallowed a tape of Trump discussing the tape during an unrelated deposition.

Later, prosecutors indicated they would ask the judge why Trump shouldn't be held in contempt for apparent violations of a gag order that Merchan imposed weeks ago. The order limits what Trump can say publicly about many of those involved in the case, including potential witnesses. Trump has attacked two well-known key witnesses in the case, Cohen and Daniels, in social media posts since Merchan issued his order. Prosecutors asked the judge to hand down a fine of $1,000 each for three Trump posts and order that they be taken down. Merchan said he would hear arguments over the issue next week.

At several points during the arguments, Trump appeared to fall asleep at the defense table, his chin appearing to drop to his chest briefly. In one instance, He was stirred awake by his attorney, Blanche, who touched his shoulder and spoke to him.

Once the final pretrial questions were resolved, 96 of the more than 500 members of the jury pool were escorted into the room. Roughly 200 were present at the courthouse. 

Merchan began by laying out the allegations against Trump, namely that he ""falsified business records to conceal an agreement with others to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election."" He continued by mentioning Cohen and Daniels.

""Specifically, it is alleged that Donald Trump made or caused false business records to hide the true nature of payments made to Michael Cohen, by characterizing them as payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a retainer agreement,"" Merchan said. ""The [prosecutors] allege that in fact, the payments were intended to reimburse Michael Cohen for money he paid to Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, in the weeks before the presidential election to prevent her from publicly revealing details about a past sexual encounter with Donald Trump.""

The roughly three dozen potential jurors who were not dismissed are being asked to respond to 42 additional questions ranging from the mundane — what jobs they hold — to the more pointed, like whether they follow Trump on social media. Some will then be called in for individual questioning. Trump's lawyers and prosecutors will seek to whittle the group of potential jurors down to just 12, plus half a dozen alternates, in a process that is expected to take at least a week, and likely longer. 

Once jury selection is over, the two sides will then begin presenting their cases, with the prosecution going first.

As a criminal defendant, Trump is required to attend proceedings each day of the trial unless he applies for and is granted a waiver. Court personnel and lawyers from both sides have said they expect the trial to last between six and eight weeks. 

Merchan reminded Trump that he must be in court every day of the trial, and issued a standard warning given to all criminal defendants that he will be subject to arrest if he fails to show up.

","In Nebraska’s U.S. Senate race, something extraordinary is happening—Dan Osborn, a nonpartisan candidate, is gaining traction at the polls, attracting national media attention, and, most importantly, securing cross-over voters.

A former union president who led a 77-day strike at Kellogg’s in 2021, Osborn was fired from the company last year and is currently an apprentice for a local steamfitter’s union in Omaha. Now, the 48-year-old father of three is spending all of his free time outside his 40-hour workweek campaigning against incumbent GOP Sen. Deb Fischer.

Sitting in a cozy Irish bar in a strip mall on the outskirts of Omaha, Osborn, a formerly registered Democrat, went over his campaign platform with USA Today—a mix of conservative and liberal ideologies, including the legalization of medical cannabis, support for the Second Amendment, expansion of reproductive rights and making it easier for unions to organize.

Coming straight from a union meeting earlier that evening, the independent candidate explained over the chatter of a group of regulars at the bar that many Nebraskans want to see a person like them in Congress.

“There’s nobody like me in the United States Senate, somebody who goes to work every day, gets dirt underneath my fingernails, comes from the working class, who’s done it for over twenty years,” Osborn said holding a Tito’s and soda while Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Sweet Home Alabama” played in the background. “I want to be a voice for people like me that work for a living.”

Nebraskan U.S Senate candidate, Dan Osborn
Last month, Oborn’s grassroots campaign collected the 4,000 signatures needed to get on the November ballot as a nonpartisan candidate. According to the latest fundraising reports, the campaign raised $456,000 in the last fiscal quarter, which puts him at $609,00 in funds—more money than any independent candidate has ever raised in the state.

A December poll conducted by a liberal research firm, Change Research, gave the blue-collar worker-turned-politician 40% of the vote compared to Fischer’s 38%, which has received skepticism from political analysts.

But he still has a long way to go.

Fischer, a two-term incumbent with a nearly $3.3 million war chest, won both 2012 and 2018 elections by a wide margin, becoming the state’s second-only female senator. Before heading to Capitol Hill, Fischer gained local political experience serving in the Nebraska Legislature and on the state school board for the Valentine Community Schools.

But Osborn, who has never been in politics, says his experience as a union leader has prepared him for office and is what inspired him to run in the first place.

“I loved the controlled chaos. I loved being the person that people counted on. And then I loved coming through for them, too,” Osborn said. “I want to do the same thing for the people of Nebraska.”

The Nebraska State AFL-CIO endorsed Osborn last month, and president and treasurer-secretary Sue Martin said Osborn is different from any other politician and can relate to the challenges Nebraskan workers face.

“Non-political ties are attractive to voters who are facing partisan fatigue,” Martin said. “He understands working people. Too often, we see corporations’ limitless funds come in. It’s time that workers have a chance.”

Nebraska: Sen. Deb Fischer (R)     • Est. net worth in 2018:  $2,776,005     • Assumed office:  Jan. 3, 2013     • Current term ends:  2025     • Approval rating:  41% approve; 40% disapprove
Fischer has also racked up multiple union endorsements too, most recently from the Omaha Police Officers Association.

Unlike Fischer, Osborn faces a fundraising challenge with no official party backing or PAC funds, and the state parties don’t quite know what to do with him as issues in his platform range from traditionally liberal to conservative.

Along with supporting both Second Amendment rights and abortion access, Osborn also supports further securing the border while also creating more pathways to citizenship in the U.S.

In an ideal world, Osborn said that he would like to see endorsements from both Republican and Democratic county parties. As a nonpartisan, he is getting invited to and attending both GOP and Democratic county party meetings, even attending the Sarpy County Libertarian convention last month.

His campaign team comprises registered Republicans, Democrats, Libertarians and nonpartisans, many of whom are tired of the political divides.

“I’ve got everybody on my campaign because we all understand that there need to be a change, there’s too much divide. At the end of the day, we’re all Americans.” Osborn said. “A lot of people are fed up with fighting with each other.”

Osborn will likely await Fischer on the ballot this November as the senator will face another Republican candidate, Arron Kowalski, in the state’s May 14 primary. Until November, Osborn says he’ll continue to raise money, mobilize voters, and travel across the state to talk to as many Nebraskans as possible.

“There’s certainly a lot of people that didn’t believe it could happen, but I enjoy proving them wrong every day,” Osborn said. “We’re getting momentum every day. So far, we haven’t had any wind taken out of our sails.”","Former British Prime Minister Liz Truss said Monday that it “has to be” former President Donald Trump in the White House after the 2024 election, endorsing the Republican for the presidency while criticizing President Joe Biden, The Hill reported.

“I don’t think Biden has been particularly supportive to the United Kingdom. I think he’s often on the side of the [European Union],” Truss said on British news radio station LBC. “And I certainly think I would like to see a new president in the White House.”

Promoting her new book, “Ten Years to Save the West,” the Conservative Party former Prime Minister said Trump’s policies “were actually very effective.”

“He cut regulation, he cut taxes, he liberated the U.S. energy supply. And this is why the U.S. has had significantly higher economic growth than Britain,” she said, adding that Trump “was more effective at preventing aggressive regimes expanding, and I think we’d be in a different position if he got reelected in 2020.”

Truss also spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington in February and wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal.

“Russia, China and Iran are seeking to defeat democracy. Any victory will give succor to the others and further embolden these dictators. We must ensure a total Ukrainian victory and defeat of the Russian invaders,” Truss wrote in The Wall Street Journal on Nov. 26, 2023.

“I hope that a Republican will be returned to the White House in 2024,” she wrote in November. “There must be conservative leadership in the U.S. that is once again bold enough to call out hostile regimes as evil and a threat.”

Trump once said he thought “very highly” of Truss in a GB News interview while she was prime minister, Politico reported.

Truss will be traveling to the United States to promote her book later this week, including speaking at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank on April 22, Politico reported.

Truss was British Prime Minister from Sept. 6, 2022, to Oct. 25, 2022. 

“Her 50-day stint as prime minister was mostly marked by its chaos, failing to pass a substantial government budget and hampered by a rotating Cabinet,” The Hill observed. “Her leadership also saw the British pound fall to its lowest value ever compared to the U.S. dollar, with economic analysts blaming her unpopular tax proposals.”

"Donald Trump does not speak from conviction. He does not speak from belief or at least any belief other than self-obsession. He certainly does not speak from anything we might recognize as reason; when he’s holding forth at a microphone, even the most careful students of Trump the rhetorician will struggle to find the light of complex thought.

You should think of Trump instead as a purely instrumental speaker. It does not matter to him whether a statement is true or false. It does not matter if one statement contradicts another in the same speech or in the same paragraph or in the same sentence. What matters to Trump is whether the words serve the purpose at hand. He will say anything if it’s what he feels an audience wants to hear or if it moves him one step closer to a personal or political goal.

Trump’s fundamental lack of interest in the truth value of his words is the only context that matters for his comments on abortion Monday morning. In a direct-to-camera statement on Truth Social, the former president told his audience that he does not support a national ban on abortion. “My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint,” Trump said. “The states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land. In this case, the law of the state.”

It should be said that this position is itself a strikingly conservative departure from mainstream thinking. Nearly two-thirds of Americans support legal abortion in most or all cases — the constitutional status quo under Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. To leave abortion rights up to the states is, as we’ve seen since the Supreme Court’s decision two years ago in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, to give state legislatures broad discretion to restrict and limit the bodily autonomy of anyone within their borders.

Compared with the mounting push from anti-abortion activists to ban the procedure nationwide, however, Trump’s stance is designed to look almost moderate. And if you were born yesterday, you could even say that Trump was beginning his pivot to the center, to blur the difference on abortion between himself and other Republicans. If he can persuade skeptical voters that he’s not a Mike Pence or a Ron DeSantis, then he’s one step closer to a second term.

But there’s no reason to take Trump’s words at face value. Trump is aware, like virtually everyone who follows American politics, that Republicans are dangerously vulnerable on abortion rights. The Biden campaign has already begun airing ads that blame Trump directly for abortion bans. He knows that he needs to neutralize this issue as much as possible without alienating his anti-abortion followers. When it looked, for example, as though support for a 15-week ban would do the trick, Trump floated support for a 15-week ban.

It does not require any particular powers of political analysis to see that Monday’s statement is a ploy — and an obvious one at that. What does Trump say immediately before giving his states’ rights position on abortion? He praises himself for ending Roe: “Many people have asked me what my position is on abortion and abortion rights, especially since I was proudly the person responsible for the ending of something that all legal scholars, both sides, wanted and, in fact, demanded be ended: Roe v. Wade.” This claim, that all sides wanted an end to Roe, is a total fabrication, but it serves to give Trump cover as he tries to be all things to all people.

Later in the video, as if to emphasize his responsibility for the end of Roe, Trump applauds the Dobbs majority, by name no less: “I want to thank the six justices — Chief Justice John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, incredible people — for having the courage to allow this long-term, hard-fought battle to finally end.”

Trump is saying what he thinks his audience — in the public and in the press — wants to hear. He’s trying to put abortion in the rearview mirror, to treat it as a settled fact that he wants a less strident approach to reproductive rights.

The truth of the matter is that given a second term in office, Trump and his allies will do everything in their power to ban abortion nationwide, with or without a Republican majority in Congress. Recall that in his 2016 campaign, Trump said that there had to be “some form” of punishment for women who had abortions. Later, as president, he backed a House bill that would have banned abortion after 20 weeks. Anti-abortion strategists have not been shy about their plan to use the 1873 Comstock Act, an anti-obscenity law, as legal authority for executive actions to limit abortions throughout the country, in blue states as well as red ones.

Opponents of abortion believe that under the act — whose enforcement produced a political and legal backlash so fierce that it made the law a dead letter for most of the 20th century — the president has the power to prohibit the mailing, sale, advertisement or distribution of any drug or instrument that could be used to cause or perform an abortion.

If you’re not inclined to put Trump’s abortion comments in the context of his habitual disregard for the truth, then you should at least put them in the context of his political coalition, which is dominated by forces and constituencies that want nothing less than the criminalization of abortion, the constitutional protection of fetal life and state regulation of bodily autonomy for the sake of patriarchal gender norms.

Trump embraced this movement and its demands as president, and there’s every reason to believe he’ll do the same with another four years in office. Put another way: When has Trump ever bucked anyone who defends him, supports him and showers him with praise?

We do not have to speculate about Trump’s relationship to abortion and reproductive rights as leader of the Republican Party. He is, after all, a former president of the United States. We already know what he wants, what he’ll do and what he’ll sign. Trump landed a major blow against legal abortion during his first term. If given a second, he will land another.","ABC News host George Stephanopoulos clashed with GOP New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu over his support for Donald Trump on Sunday in a heated debate over the Republican governor's past condemnation of the former president. 

Sununu, who endorsed Haley in the GOP primary until she dropped out, said in March he would endorse Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, in the presidential election. Stephanopoulos asked if his support for Trump would continue if he's convicted in the hush money case.

""This trial is not going to have major political ramifications that a lot of people think it may have. When it comes to these issues, people see it more as reality TV at this point,"" Sununu replied. ""He’ll try to victimize it, and that has worked for him. This has been going on for over a year, and his poll numbers never seem to go down because of the issue.""

Stephanopoulos insisted he was asking Sununu about right and wrong, rather than politics, and asked multiple times if he would be ""swayed"" by a conviction.

NANCY MACE PUSHES BACK ON GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS IN HEATED EXCHANGE OVER TRUMP SUPPORT: ‘TRYING TO SHAME ME'

Sununu argued that the cases against Trump were not going to sway the American public and said it shouldn't be surprising that a Republican governor was endorsing the Republican nominee for president. 

""Wait a second. Your words were very, very clear on January 11, 2021. You said his rhetoric and actions contributed to the insurrection. No other president in history has contributed to an insurrection. Please explain, given the fact you believe he contributed to an insurrection, how you can say we should have him back in the Oval Office?"" Stephanopoulos asked. 

The GOP governor also said it was less about Trump but more about support for a Republican administration. 

""That doesn’t make any sense to me, governor. I’m sorry. You’re saying it’s not about Trump. He would be the president, and he’s somebody who contributed to an insurrection,"" Stephanopoulos said.

'I TELL THE TRUTH': TRUMP SAYS HE'LL TESTIFY AT HUSH MONEY TRIAL AS JUDGE REJECTS LAST MINUTE PLEA

Sununu responded and said 51% of the U.S. was supporting Trump and added, ""they're not crazy.""

""I understand it doesn’t make sense to you, George, but look at the polls. What you are telling me is you don’t understand why 51% of this country is supporting Donald Trump. They’re not crazy. They’re not MAGA conservatives. They’re not extremists. They want culture change,"" he said. 

Stephanopoulos questioned Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., in March over her support for the president as well. The ABC News host asked how she squared her support for the GOP president with the fact that she was a rape victim. 

Stephanopoulos pushed back again, and said he wasn't talking about polls. 

""I’m asking you a very simple question. You believe Donald Trump contributed to an insurrection. That’s correct, right?"" he said. 

""I stand by the statement,"" Sununu responded. Stephanopoulos asked again how he could support Trump.","Former President Donald Trump on Saturday endorsed the Senate campaign of Republican Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania after initially being reluctant to endorse the former hedge fund executive who is challenging Democrat Bob Casey in a critical Senate battleground.

“I am officially giving my endorsement to David McCormick tonight. He’s a good a man. He wants to run a good ship. He’s a smart guy, who was a very successful guy. He’s given up a lot to do this,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, his last official campaign event before jury selection in his criminal hush money trial in New York begins Monday.

McCormick, who announced his campaign for Senate in September, is running unopposed in the April 23 Republican primary.

“I’ll tell you what: He’s the nominee of the Republican Party, David McCormick. Go out and vote for him because Casey doesn’t do a damn thing,” Trump said.

As CNN previously reported, people close to the former president said Trump’s resistance to weighing in early on the Senate race in Pennsylvania was not entirely surprising: Trump and McCormick have a fraught history, dating back to McCormick’s failed 2022 primary bid for the state’s other Senate seat against celebrity heart surgeon Mehmet Oz.

McCormick was not at Saturday’s rally. His campaign told CNN the candidate had a previously scheduled family event, a commitment he made long before Trump announced his planned rally.

McCormick thanked Trump for the endorsement in a social media post after the rally, saying, “Together we will deliver a big win for Pennsylvania and America in November.”

The former president has now endorsed all candidates backed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee in the major swing states, except Nevada. (And while he has not yet formally backed a candidate in the Senate race in Nevada, he posted on social media Friday that Republican hopeful Sam Brown and the former president himself were the “Clear Choices of Nevada’s Republican Voters and Donors.”)

Swing state success
Trump’s visit to Pennsylvania on Saturday comes as his team looks to replicate his stunning 2016 victory in the Keystone State on his way to winning the White House. The result, combined with his wins in Michigan and Wisconsin, created a seismic crack in the so-called blue wall of states Democrats had relied on in every election going back to 1992.

Joe Biden flipped all three states in 2020. Trump and Biden remain locked in a close race for the presidency, with registered voters nationwide splitting 46% for Trump to 45% for Biden, according to a new poll from The New York Times and Siena College.

At the start of his rally Saturday, Trump acknowledged Iran’s launch of a wave of strikes toward Israel in retaliation for last week’s deadly Israeli strike on an Iranian embassy complex in Syria.

“God bless the people of Israel. They’re under attack right now. … That’s because we show great weakness,” Trump said. “It’s unbelievable, and it would not have happened if we were in office.”

Shortly after, shouts of “Genocide Joe” broke out among some rally attendees positioned behind Trump.

The former president stopped his speech to turn around and look at them, before saying, “They’re not wrong. They’re not wrong. He’s done everything wrong.”

The slogan “Genocide Joe” has been used in recent months by some Biden critics to denounce his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. It was unclear Saturday whether the Trump rallygoers were using the slogan to convey the same message.

Biden has faced fierce criticism and condemnation from pro-Palestinian activists – including protests and interruptions at public events in the past several months – over his response to the Gaza conflict.

Hush money trial
Saturday’s rally was Trump’s last scheduled campaign event before jury selection begins Monday in his New York hush money trial. Following the rally, Trump was expected to fly straight to New York City, where he will be prepared by members of his legal team on Sunday on court protocol and messaging, a source familiar with his plans told CNN.

Trump will juggle appearances in courtroom and on campaign trail as hush money trial begins
Trump spent a lengthy amount of time Saturday railing against the case, but he told supporters he was “proud to do it for you.” He also claimed once again that the case represented election interference and had no merit.

“It’s a joke all over the world, but when I walk into that courtroom, I know I will have the love of 200 million Americans behind me,” Trump said. “And I will be fighting for the freedom of 325 million Americans.”

As his trial commences, the former president will have to juggle his time between the courtroom and the campaign trail at a crucial period for his general election bid. He is required to be present in court the entire time – every weekday, except Wednesday – with the schedule set by the court. Trump’s team is working around the limitations to keep him interacting with voters and donors.

His next scheduled campaign appearance after jury selection starts is on April 20, when he is expected to go to North Carolina for a campaign event and fundraiser.

Interceptions by Israel’s sophisticated air and missile defense systems began overnight, causing loud booms over Jerusalem and air raid sirens to sound across the country. The military warned citizens to brace for an attack of undetermined scale, as combat aircraft filled the sky over much of Israel. Officials closed schools and banned large gatherings as some airports in the region halted operations.


American military forces also shot down some Iranian attack drones, said U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive and fluid operation. It did not appear that any U.S. facilities or personnel in the region were targeted by the Iranian onslaught, President Biden said in a statement condemning the “unprecedented” violence.

The Biden administration is urging Israeli officials not to escalate tensions in the region after their coalition stopped more than 300 Iranian-launched drones and missiles heading toward Israel. Follow live updates.

A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, speaking in a short televised briefing about 3 a.m. Sunday in Israel, said that the attack was ongoing and that the IDF had intercepted the “vast majority” of weapons launched at the Jewish state, though at least one person — a young girl — was reported injured. He called the Iranian strikes a “major escalation” and said Israeli forces were operating at “full force” to defend their country.

Tehran’s attack was “four-pronged,” according to a report by the state-run Tasnim News Agency, originating from sites in Iran, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen. The agency is affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Anticipated for days, the assault followed Israeli strikes April 1 on an Iranian diplomatic compound in the Syrian capital of Damascus. Those strikes killed two Iranian generals and other Iranian military officers, eliciting from Tehran an immediate vow to retaliate.

U.S. officials quickly distanced themselves from the strikes, saying Israel had not given the United States any advance notice. Privately, a frustrated Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin later complained to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that the Damascus operation put American forces in the Middle East at risk and U.S. officials should have known it was coming.

Iran’s counterattack required Israelis to endure a days-long, dread-filled countdown. Many families had already heeded warnings to equip safe rooms and shelters with water and food. The IDF said it had lifted a shield of fighter planes and air-defense systems over Israel and intended to intercept as many of incoming threats as it could before they entered Israeli airspace.

“Continue to act responsibly and calmly, as you have done so far, and be sure to follow the guidelines,” Hagari cautioned Israelis earlier. “ … We have prepared for a variety of scenarios in advance.”

Hagari later said Iran had launched missiles from its territory. “You may hear explosions from interceptions or debris falling,” he warned.

One official said the IDF was monitoring for additional waves of airborne attacks.

Grant Shapps, Britain’s secretary of state for defense, said in a statement that London would send additional fighter jets and tanker planes to the region, and that British aircraft “will intercept any airborne attacks within range of our existing missions, as required.” Videos circulating online showed Iranian weapons being intercepted over Amman, Jordan, early Sunday.

Biden traveled by helicopter Saturday from his Delaware beach house to the White House, where he met in the Situation Room for roughly two hours with members of his national security team, officials said. Later in the evening, he spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

“I told him,” Biden said in his statement, “that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks — sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel.”

Biden’s top aides will “continue to work with partners in the region to prevent further escalation,” said a U.S. defense official.

Intelligence reports had swelled for days with warnings that Tehran was poised to retaliate. The Biden administration, fearing that U.S. troops might also be targeted, began last week to dispatch more ships and warplanes to the region.

After six months of war in Gaza and fire from Iran-backed militants in Lebanon and Yemen, leaders and analysts from Washington to Cairo have warned that an attack from Tehran, especially one launched directly from Iran on Israel, could spark an even wider conflagration. Numerous top administration figures warned Iran in recent days that the United States’ support for Israel’s security was “ironclad.”

“The United States will stand with the people of Israel and support their defense against these threats from Iran,” National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in statement.

But earlier Saturday, Iran appeared to brush aside the cautions when Revolutionary Guard naval forces stormed the MSC Aries, an Israel-affiliated ship near the Strait of Hormuz, and diverted the vessel to Iranian territorial waters.

Shortly after the launch of what Israeli officials called “killer drones,” the Iranian IRGC said the airborne attack was aimed at “specific targets” in Israel. Iranian state media said the swarm of drones was retaliation for the Damascus strike.

Israel’s war cabinet went into an emergency session at midnight Saturday, and the Pentagon said that Austin had spoken again with Gallant. Officials in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq closed airports and restricted airspace.

“There is no question this is an escalation. There is no question that the Iranians have now given Israel the legitimacy to attack on Iranian soil,” Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli brigadier general and national security adviser, said in an interview.


Tensions in the region quickly spiked to perhaps their highest levels since the Oct. 7 attack on Israeli towns by Hamas and the ensuing war in Gaza.

Israel has exchanged fire across its border almost daily with Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon, and officials directed residents of some northern towns to seek shelter after air raid sirens sounded early Sunday. Yemen-based Houthi rebels, another Iranian proxy group, have launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Red Sea shipping and toward Israel.

But until now, a full-fledged attack by any of the Tehran-backed forces — which Hamas leader Yehiya Sinwar called for — had not materialized.

“We don’t want to fight multiple major wars at once, and so far, we haven’t had to,” an Israeli official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss security matters. “But we are ready to, and maybe that is where we are.”

Military experts said Israeli multilevel air defense networks, along with U.S.-built F-35 fighter jets, have proved effective against a range of airborne threats. Israel’s well-known Iron Dome system has frequently shown an interception rate of well over 90 percent during rocket attacks from Islamist militants in Gaza.

But with the scale and duration of the attack still unclear, they warned that Iran was capable of deploying a fearsome arsenal.

“With a combination of drones, cruise missiles and likely ballistic missiles to come, what they are trying to do is to overwhelm the system,” Amidror said. “Each is problematic by itself, but together they are more challenging. This is unprecedented. It means Iran opened a new chapter in the war.”

The IDF said it was immediately focused on defending against the attacks and would determine its response at a later time. Officials said they intended to intercept as many of the drones as possible before they reached Israeli airspace.

“If we’re not successful, then we will do what we do and what we have been doing for the last six months over Israeli skies,” the IDF official said.

Iran’s U.N. mission in New York said on X that the attack should be taken as its promised response to the strike on its diplomatic compound and that the “matter can be deemed concluded.”

But the post continued, “Should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe. It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!”

In Washington, Democrats and Republicans condemned the attack and asserted that Israel has a right to defend itself. While Biden’s allies in Congress praised his resolve, some in the GOP took aim at the president, saying that, by showing weakness toward Iran, he had emboldened its regime.

Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, credited Israelis, Americans and unnamed regional partners “who worked together to shoot down hundreds of Iranian drones and missiles through the night.” The United States will stand alongside Israel, he said, urging Iran to cease the attack and Israel to “act with prudence and wisdom.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who for months has blocked a spending bill that would send billions of dollars in additional military aid to both Israel and Ukraine, called the attack by Iran “vicious,” and said the United States must show “full resolve” as it stand with Israel.

“I will continue to engage with the White House to insist upon a proper response,” Johnson said, not mentioning the stalled aid package. “The Biden Administration’s undermining of Israel and appeasement of Iran have contributed to these terrible developments.”

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) implored Biden to “lead an international effort to impose sufficient costs on Tehran” and urged the House to pass the $95 billion national security supplemental funding, which he noted “has waited months for action.”

Biden, in his statement, said that he would convene a group of world leaders to coordinate a diplomatic response to Iran’s attack.

“While we have not seen attacks on our forces or facilities today,” Biden said, “we will remain vigilant to all threats and will not hesitate to take all necessary action to protect our people.”

“We are slowed down by those who think of themselves as grownups and believe decarbonisation at the speed the climate community calls for is unrealistic,” said Todd Stern, who served as a special envoy for climate change under Barack Obama, and helped negotiate the 2015 Paris agreement.

“They say that we need to slow down, that what is being proposed [in cuts to greenhouse gas emissions] is unrealistic,” he told the Observer. “You see it a lot in the business world too. It’s really hard [to push for more urgency] because those ‘grownups’ have a lot of influence.”

But Stern said the speed of take-up of renewable energy, its falling cost, and the wealth of low-carbon technology now available were evidence that the world could cut emissions to net zero by 2050. “Obviously it’s difficult – we’re talking about enormous change to the world economy – but we can do it,” he said.

Stern would not name any world leaders, but he said the UK was in “retrenchment” over climate issues. Rishi Sunak and Claire Coutinho, the energy secretary, made several U-turns on climate policy last year, and have repeatedly said climate policies imposed “unacceptable costs on hard-pressed British families” and that by slowing such action they were “being pragmatic and protecting family finances”.

Stern said that, in fact, delaying action to cut greenhouse gas emissions was leading to disaster, given the rapid acceleration of the climate crisis, which he said was happening faster than predicted when the Paris agreement was signed. “Look out your window – look at what’s happening,look at the preposterous heat. It’s ridiculous.”

Leaders who claimed to be grownups by saying the pace of action had to be slowed had to be honest about the alternatives, he said. Just as political leaders took swift action to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in 2020, so must they confront the consequences of slowing climate action now.

“All hard questions of this magnitude should be considered by way of a ‘compared to what’ analysis. The monumental dangers [the climate crisis] poses warrant the same kind of ‘compared to what’ argument when leaders in the political and corporate worlds balk at what needs to be done.”

He warned of the backlash against climate action by “rightwing populism” in Europe. “Hopefully, it doesn’t go very far,” he said. “If that kind of attitude gets some purchase among parts of the population, that’s not helpful.”

Stern praised Joe Biden for “an extraordinarily good first term”, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which he called “far and away the most significant climate legislation ever in the US, and it’s quite powerful”.

But he warned that if Donald Trump were to be elected this November, the US would exit the Paris agreement and frustrate climate action globally.

“He will try to reverse whatever he can in terms of domestic policy [on climate action],” he warned. “I don’t think anybody else is going to pull out of Paris because of Trump, but it’s highly disruptive to what can happen internationally, because the US is a very big, very important player. So [without the US] you don’t move as fast.”

Stern called for stronger demonstration from civil society of support for climate action. “What we need, broadly, is normative change, a shift in hearts and minds that demonstrates to political leaders that their political future depends on taking strong, unequivocal action to protect our world,” he said.

“Normative change may seem at first blush like a weak reed to carry into battle against the defenders of the status quo, but norms can move mountains. They are about a sense of what is right, what is acceptable, what is important, what we expect and what we demand.”

Stern first gave his warning in a lecture at the London School of Economics on Friday night, in honour of the British civil servant Pete Betts, who served as the EU’s chief climate negotiator for the Paris agreement. He died last year.","I was about 10 years old when my best friend and I had what my family now laughingly refers to as the “holy water fight.” It all stemmed from a dispute over a goal during a recess soccer game in our summer church youth program. The details of the incident that prompted the fight are disputed to this day (it was not a goal) and led to my friend Steve and I brawling and rolling into the long brush bordering the grassy field we turned into our makeshift playing field.

The church’s message this week likely stamped out whatever hope I ever had to come back to Catholic services.

I can still remember the fury on the face of the chaperone who broke us up, a mustachioed man whose name I’ve long forgotten. Steve and I were still heated with each other as we re-entered the chapel to resume our Bible class. In a moment of frustration — or inspiration, depending on how you look at it — as we passed the holy water font near the entrance to the chapel, I reached out and slapped the water right at Steve.

Good Lord did I get in trouble for that decision, but it makes for a fond memory Steve and I, and my family, still regularly talk about to this day.

Growing up, my local Roman Catholic was my most important social connection outside of school. Most of my childhood friends were also Catholic, and every Sunday, we’d look forward to seeing each other at church. I knew even then that I was closeted transgender girl, though I did not understand at the time what that would end up meaning for my relationship with the church.

On Monday the Vatican released a document calling gender-affirming care “contrary to human dignity,” throwing my relationship with my faith even further away than it already was. I am a cradle Catholic — I grew up getting all the sacraments, from baptism to First Communion — but the church’s message this week likely stamped out whatever hope I ever had to come back to Catholic services.

I first left the church in 2002, not long after my confirmation, when the Boston Globe began exposing rampant church sexual abuse. I was not the only New England Catholic to stop supporting the church at that time. But back then, my deeply closeted trans identity wasn’t yet a factor in my alienation from the church.

Every once in a while, driving past a local Roman Catholic church, I’d reminisce about my youth in the church, of the camaraderie I had with my Bible class friends, of the neighbors I would shake hands with before, during and after Mass, and I’d feel a pull back to my roots. But as it became increasingly clear that I wouldn’t be able to suppress my gender identity in my mid-30s, I understood that the likelihood of returning to the church grew ever more remote. Why go back to an institution that so clearly wanted no part of me?

In place of church services, I have adopted a private spirituality. I still retain the excessive Catholic guilt that so many people who grew up in the church end up with, and I often contemplate my own mortality and how I can leave a positive legacy on the planet after I’m gone. There’s none of the pomp and circumstance — or community — of my childhood church, but that’s how I’ve maintained my spiritual health outside of Catholicism.

There have been a lot of headlines over the last few years about the “woke pope” Pope Francis, who has repeatedly called on Catholics to stop persecuting gay and lesbian people. He even met with a group of trans women as part of his so-called message of inclusivity not that long ago. But despite such gestures, the Vatican has always been one of the main players in anti-LGBTQ persecution in the Christian world.

Indeed, even the now-common term “gender ideology,” an amorphous phrase that means different things in different Western countries depending on that country’s conservative agenda (in Central America it mostly means abortion rights; in the U.S. it refers to trans people), started with the Vatican in 2003. “Although actors may not be aware of its religious origins, the discourse on ‘gender ideology’ often resonates with [conservative] ideas and criticisms of gender,” David Paternotte and Roman Kuhar wrote in their book “Anti-Gender Campaigns in Europe.” “In this context, ‘gender ideology’ becomes a ‘threat’ — an empty signifier which allows coalition making with a variety of actors precisely because of its ‘populist emptiness.’”

The Vatican has always been one of the main players in anti-LGBTQ persecution in the Christian world.

As I’ve gotten older, I’ve thought often of returning to my faith in some form. I miss the community I had as a child. There’s still a strange comfort in the scriptures for me, as I think about the Bible stories I grew up with. There are lessons to be learned in the story of the Good Samaritan, and I can’t help but cheer along during the story of Jesus flipping tables to drive the merchants out of the temple. I still think about Jesus telling his disciples that eunuchs can inherit the kingdom of heaven, and I smile. But the church’s dictate Monday is far removed from the Jesus I learned about who embraced the downtrodden and the eunuchs of the ancient world.

I haven’t been able to regain that sense of community I enjoyed in my childhood, and I’m not the only trans person lacking in-person community. According to a 2023 study, trans people are significantly more likely to feel lonely, isolated or excluded compared to the general population. The Jesus I learned about when I was younger would want trans people to find community in church.

But the Catholic Church has made clear for centuries that we simply aren’t welcome, most recently by calling our lifesaving medication a threat to human dignity. But from my perspective, big international religious organizations encouraging their institutions and followers to obsess over the possible genitalia of a small and highly marginalized demographic is completely devoid of dignity.

It’s also rich that the Vatican is so intent on alienating people like me while still struggling with its child abuse scandal. “He who is without sin among you, let him cast a stone at her,” Jesus is quoted as saying in the Gospel of John.

I understand that the church has religious beliefs, but trans people aren’t even mentioned in the Bible, making it strange that the church would so heavily focus on us as a minority for persecution. Young people in the West are leaving churches in droves in large part because of homophobia and transphobia. It’s disappointing to see the Vatican lean in on bigotry against people like me.

I’d love to come home to my church, but its opinions of me and my community make it impossible to do so. I’m not willing to abandon my trans identity or my health care, but I promise not to touch the holy water again.","White House spokesperson John Kirby on Sunday praised the ""extraordinary success"" of Israel's defense against a massive drone and missile attack unleashed by Iran on Saturday night but said that the U.S. does not want to see further escalation between the two nations or a broadening battle in the Middle East.

Kirby told ABC News ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos that the capabilities exhibited on Saturday underscored the ""unprecedented sense of resolve and determination and military capability"" by the U.S., Israel and other allies.

""It should tell everybody else that Israel is not alone, that this was a coalition put together to help Israel defend itself,"" Kirby said. ""Iran is just increasingly further isolated in the region.""

Still, he conceded that more will only be known ""in the coming days"" about how the long-simmering conflict between Israel and Iran progresses after Iran's direct attack on Israel in retaliation for the bombing of Iran's consulate in Damascus, Syria, earlier this month.

The Damascus strike, which Iran said killed top Iranian military officials as well as others, was blamed on Israel, who has not publicly commented. The Middle East has already been unsettled by an ongoing, six-month-old war between Israel and Hamas, sparked by Hamas' October terror attack.

""The president has been very clear, publicly so: We don't seek a war with Iran,"" Kirby said on ""This Week."" ""We don't seek an escalated tensions in the region. We don't seek a wider conflict. And everything he's been doing, literally since the seventh of October, has been designed to that outcome.""

Those remarks come after Iran launched more than 300 drone and missiles at Israel, Israeli officials said, marking the first time such an attack has emanated directly from Iranian territory rather than through its proxies elsewhere in the Middle East. The Israeli military said that 99% of the bombardment was intercepted, many outside of Israeli airspace.

While Iranian officials celebrated the barrage, minimal damage was recorded inside of Israel, according to Israeli officials. A 10-year-old girl injured by shrapnel is the only casualty recorded thus far, and a military base in southern Israel suffered minor damage but is still operational.

""However, it is important to say -- the event is not over. We remain prepared and ready for further developments and threats,"" military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a statement.

Iran's retaliation had been forecast for weeks and Iranian officials stressed afterward that the country ""has no intention"" of further operations, which it described as a proportional response to the strike in Damascus.

With the attack failing to do significant damage to Israel or its military capabilities, Kirby indicated on ""This Week"" that the White House would prefer to keep the situation from spiraling out of control.

Referring to President Joe Biden, Kirby said, ""Everything he's been doing since Oct. 7 has been to try to keep this from becoming a wider regional war. And he pre-positioned forces, even in the last few days, destroyers and fighter squadrons into the region to help Israel defend itself to keep it from becoming a wider war, to keep it from escalating further.""

It is still unclear precisely how Israel plans to respond to Iran.

Kirby told Stephanopoulos that Biden's message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been simple regarding threats from Iran: ""He congratulated the prime minister on an extraordinary achievement and success last night, but also to reiterate that the United States is going to continue to help Israel defend itself. That's a commitment going back many, many administrations and the president believes wholeheartedly in it.""

Kirby rebuffed criticism of Biden by rival Donald Trump that the president is inept on the world stage, leading to foreign crises. Kirby pointed to Biden traveling to Israel soon after its war with Hamas began as well as to how the U.S. had helped marshal defensive operations for Israel.

""That's leadership not just in the world, but it shows the power of American leadership around the world,"" Kirby said.

Stephanopoulos also asked Kirby about negotiations for hostages thought to still be held by Hamas during the war in Gaza, which is ongoing while Israel defends itself against Iran.

Kirby said the White House hopes Hamas takes a deal that was put on the table, though it is still unclear if Hamas intends to do so and how many living hostages it has to trade. In exchange, the fighting would be paused for more than a month to allow for more aid and support for civilians in Gaza.

""Hamas needs to take that deal. It's a good deal.

","Denver — Colorado's Democratic-controlled House on Sunday passed a bill that would ban the sale and transfer of semiautomatic firearms, a major step for the legislation after roughly the same bill was swiftly killed by Democrats last year.

The bill, which passed on a 35-27 vote, is now on its way to the Democratic-led state Senate. If it passes there, it could bring Colorado in line with 10 other states - including California, New York and Illinois - that have prohibitions on semiautomatic guns.

But even in a state plagued by some of the nation's worst mass shootings, such legislation faces headwinds.

Colorado's political history is purple, shifting blue only recently. The bill's chances of success in the state Senate are lower than they were in the House, where Democrats have a 46-19 majority and a bigger far-left flank. Gov. Jared Polis, also a Democrat, has indicated his wariness over such a ban.

Last year, a similar bill died in committee, with some Democratic lawmakers citing concerns over the sweep of a ban and promises they made to their constituents to avoid government overreach affecting most gun owners' rights.

Democrats last year passed and Polis signed into law four less-expansive gun control bills. Those included raising the age for buying any gun from 18 to 21; establishing a three-day waiting period between the purchase and receipt of a gun; strengthening the state's red flag law; and rolling back some legal protections for the firearms industry, exposing it to lawsuits from the victims of gun violence.

Those laws were signed months after five people were killed at an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs last year. Soon, the state will mark the 25th anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting that killed 13 people. Other mass shootings in Colorado include 12 people killed in 2012 at an Aurora movie theater and 10 people killed in 2021 at a Boulder supermarket.

""This is the state where the modern era of the mass shooting began with Columbine,"" Democratic Rep. Javier Mabrey said in urging fellow lawmakers to join other states that ban semiautomatic weapons.

Republicans decried the legislation as an onerous encroachment on the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment. They argued that mental illness and people who do not value life - not guns - are the issues that should be addressed. People with ill intent can use other weapons, such as knives, to harm others, they argued.

Democrats responded that semiautomatic weapons can cause much more damage in a short period of time.

""In Aurora, when the shooter walked in that theater and opened fire,"" Mabrey said, ""and in less than 90 seconds shot up a room full of people. That cannot be done with a knife, that can't be done with a knife.""","In Nebraska’s U.S. Senate race, something extraordinary is happening—Dan Osborn, a nonpartisan candidate, is gaining traction at the polls, attracting national media attention, and, most importantly, securing cross-over voters.

A former union president who led a 77-day strike at Kellogg’s in 2021, Osborn was fired from the company last year and is currently an apprentice for a local steamfitter’s union in Omaha. Now, the 48-year-old father of three is spending all of his free time outside his 40-hour workweek campaigning against incumbent GOP Sen. Deb Fischer.

Sitting in a cozy Irish bar in a strip mall on the outskirts of Omaha, Osborn, a formerly registered Democrat, went over his campaign platform with USA Today—a mix of conservative and liberal ideologies, including the legalization of medical cannabis, support for the Second Amendment, expansion of reproductive rights and making it easier for unions to organize.

Coming straight from a union meeting earlier that evening, the independent candidate explained over the chatter of a group of regulars at the bar that many Nebraskans want to see a person like them in Congress.

“There’s nobody like me in the United States Senate, somebody who goes to work every day, gets dirt underneath my fingernails, comes from the working class, who’s done it for over twenty years,” Osborn said holding a Tito’s and soda while Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Sweet Home Alabama” played in the background. “I want to be a voice for people like me that work for a living.”

Nebraskan U.S Senate candidate, Dan Osborn
Last month, Oborn’s grassroots campaign collected the 4,000 signatures needed to get on the November ballot as a nonpartisan candidate. According to the latest fundraising reports, the campaign raised $456,000 in the last fiscal quarter, which puts him at $609,00 in funds—more money than any independent candidate has ever raised in the state.

A December poll conducted by a liberal research firm, Change Research, gave the blue-collar worker-turned-politician 40% of the vote compared to Fischer’s 38%, which has received skepticism from political analysts.

But he still has a long way to go.

Fischer, a two-term incumbent with a nearly $3.3 million war chest, won both 2012 and 2018 elections by a wide margin, becoming the state’s second-only female senator. Before heading to Capitol Hill, Fischer gained local political experience serving in the Nebraska Legislature and on the state school board for the Valentine Community Schools.

But Osborn, who has never been in politics, says his experience as a union leader has prepared him for office and is what inspired him to run in the first place.

“I loved the controlled chaos. I loved being the person that people counted on. And then I loved coming through for them, too,” Osborn said. “I want to do the same thing for the people of Nebraska.”

The Nebraska State AFL-CIO endorsed Osborn last month, and president and treasurer-secretary Sue Martin said Osborn is different from any other politician and can relate to the challenges Nebraskan workers face.

“Non-political ties are attractive to voters who are facing partisan fatigue,” Martin said. “He understands working people. Too often, we see corporations’ limitless funds come in. It’s time that workers have a chance.”

Nebraska: Sen. Deb Fischer (R)     • Est. net worth in 2018:  $2,776,005     • Assumed office:  Jan. 3, 2013     • Current term ends:  2025     • Approval rating:  41% approve; 40% disapprove
Fischer has also racked up multiple union endorsements too, most recently from the Omaha Police Officers Association.

Unlike Fischer, Osborn faces a fundraising challenge with no official party backing or PAC funds, and the state parties don’t quite know what to do with him as issues in his platform range from traditionally liberal to conservative.

Along with supporting both Second Amendment rights and abortion access, Osborn also supports further securing the border while also creating more pathways to citizenship in the U.S.

In an ideal world, Osborn said that he would like to see endorsements from both Republican and Democratic county parties. As a nonpartisan, he is getting invited to and attending both GOP and Democratic county party meetings, even attending the Sarpy County Libertarian convention last month.

His campaign team comprises registered Republicans, Democrats, Libertarians and nonpartisans, many of whom are tired of the political divides.

“I’ve got everybody on my campaign because we all understand that there need to be a change, there’s too much divide. At the end of the day, we’re all Americans.” Osborn said. “A lot of people are fed up with fighting with each other.”

Osborn will likely await Fischer on the ballot this November as the senator will face another Republican candidate, Arron Kowalski, in the state’s May 14 primary. Until November, Osborn says he’ll continue to raise money, mobilize voters, and travel across the state to talk to as many Nebraskans as possible.

“There’s certainly a lot of people that didn’t believe it could happen, but I enjoy proving them wrong every day,” Osborn said. “We’re getting momentum every day. So far, we haven’t had any wind taken out of our sails.”","Trump campaign senior adviser Lynne Patton told Newsmax on Monday that the former president's New York business records trial is a ""full-frontal assault on American democracy.""

""Never before has our argument that this is election interference been more clear than by virtue of the fact that the leading presidential candidate is required by law to appear in person four days a week from 9 to 5 in this court in New York, far away from his home base in Palm Beach, Florida, while his poll-plummeting opponent gets to campaign freely across this country without any hindrance,"" Patton said on ""National Report.""

""Obviously, they've been saying the quiet part out loud by bragging about how much money this is diverting from the Trump campaign to cover his legal fees, so it's obvious that that's their intent — to break this man both politically, monetarily, spiritually and, obviously, emotionally.""

Appearing in court Monday morning in his signature blue suit and red tie, Trump, 77, became the first former U.S. president to stand trial in a criminal case.

New York state prosecutors accused Trump of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 payment during the 2016 presidential campaign to silence porn star Stormy Daniels about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter.

Trump has denied the accusations and pleaded not guilty last year to 34 counts of falsification of business records in the case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat.

Asked about internal conversations about campaigning, given Trump's court-packed schedule, Patton said. ""The more he's attacked, the more driven he is to defend the American people.""

""This is a persecution, not a prosecution, and they're going after him because they can't go after you,"" Patton said. ""And, at the end of the day, this is a case that, obviously, was considered a zombie case in the halls of the DA's office. Bragg, his predecessor, the Southern District of New York, the FEC [Federal Election Commission] all refused to bring it forward.

""As you said, this isn't a hush money case; this is a case about bookmaking errors, which we stand by are accurate. At the end of the day, Trump was not responsible for bookkeeping errors. He did not make these entries personally and, in fact, was president of the United States when these entries were made.""

Trump has tried unsuccessfully to get the judge in the New York case to step aside, arguing that he has a conflict of interest because his daughter has worked with Democrat politicians.

""This is an outrage,"" Trump said before entering the courtroom. ""This is political persecution."""
"The Supreme Court reputedly has a long-awaited conservative majority committed to enforcing the meaning of the Constitution as it was understood when it was adopted. This commitment to originalist interpretation will soon be tested in two cases now before the court that have what lawyers call bad optics.

One case, United States v. Rahimi, involves a Second Amendment challenge to a federal statute criminalizing the possession of firearms by people subject to certain domestic violence restraining orders. State courts typically use these orders to forbid threatening or abusive conduct toward the subject’s intimate partner. The federal gun ban is automatically imposed if the order either says that the subject presents a credible threat to the physical safety of the partner or explicitly forbids the use of physical force against the partner.

The other case, Garland v. Cargill, involves a regulatory ban on bump stocks that enable a semiautomatic rifle to achieve a rate of fire comparable to that of fully automatic machine guns. After a 2017 Las Vegas massacre in which semiautomatic rifles equipped with bump stocks were used to kill 60 people and injure hundreds more, the Trump administration classified them as machine guns, which made them illegal.

No judge can relish being accused of siding with domestic abusers or of allowing a weapon to remain on the market that facilitated mass murder. Unless the court rules in favor of the government in these cases, denunciations undoubtedly will follow, especially in an election year.

These cases have come before a court that has been transformed by Republican efforts to stop the politicized use of judicial power to effect progressive social change. What began with calls for judicial restraint during the Nixon era eventually became a long campaign devoted to promoting originalist theories of interpretation.

This effort had its first conspicuous success in 2008, when a 5-to-4 majority struck down a handgun ban in District of Columbia v. Heller. Justice Antonin Scalia’s majority opinion featured a detailed originalist analysis that rejected an overwhelming and longstanding consensus in the lower courts. Rather than assume that the Second Amendment protects only a right of state governments to maintain militia organizations, the court concluded that the constitutional “right of the people to keep and bear arms” may be exercised by individuals for the purpose of self-defense.

Although the decision was seen as a milestone for originalism, the lower courts refused to go along. They adopted a deferential balancing test — like the one advocated by Justice Stephen Breyer in his Heller dissent — under which the courts should uphold almost any regulation that might serve the worthy purpose of promoting public safety. Applying that approach, the lower courts essentially rubber-stamped virtually every gun-control law they reviewed.

In 2022 the Supreme Court struck back. In New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen, the court invalidated a New York law that forbade individuals to carry a firearm in public unless they could persuade a government official that they faced some extraordinary threat to their personal safety. This was an easy case on originalist grounds because a right restricted to a tiny subset of the population cannot be the “right of the people” that the Constitution says “shall not be infringed.”

But the court went further, adopting a new legal test designed to enforce the original meaning of the Second Amendment. When defending a law that deprives an individual of the freedom to keep or bear arms, the court said, the government has the burden of proving that the law “is consistent with the nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” Thus, for example, the absence of a historical regulation “distinctly similar” to a modern gun-control law is evidence of the modern regulation’s unconstitutionality. And Bruen ruled out traditions that did not begin until the 20th century.

This is a plausible way to identify certain exceptions to the Constitution’s linguistically unqualified prohibition. Just as the court has assumed that the First Amendment’s protection of “the freedom of speech” was not meant to ban longstanding and uncontroversial laws against perjury and fraud, similarly longstanding and well-accepted regulations of weapons would presumably not infringe the right protected by the Second Amendment.

Under Bruen’s originalist test, Rahimi should be an easy case. The government has not informed the Supreme Court of a single pre-20th-century law that punished American citizens, even those who had been convicted of a violent crime, for possessing a gun in their own homes. Not one.

The subject of the case, Zackey Rahimi, however, is an unsympathetic defendant. His ex-girlfriend obtained a protective order against him on the ground that he had assaulted her, and he has been charged with several crimes involving the misuse of firearms. Although he apparently had not been convicted of any offenses when the restraining order was issued, that order immediately and automatically criminalized his possession of a firearm under federal law.

If the court pretends that a historical tradition of such laws existed, it will not be faithful either to Bruen’s holding or to the court’s repeated insistence that the right to keep and bear arms is not “a second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.”

Imagine that an overwrought woman called her ex-boyfriend and threatened to scratch his eyes out. If a state court ordered her to refrain from making such calls and from physically attacking him, the federal statute at issue in Rahimi would automatically make her a felon if she kept a gun in her own home. And that would be true even if she had good reason to fear a violent attack from the ex-boyfriend or his criminal associates. But no court would uphold a statute that made this restraining order a sufficient basis on which to criminalize her possession of a telephone. We will soon find out whether the Supreme Court takes the Second Amendment as seriously as the First.

The fidelity of the conservative justices to originalist legal principles will also be tested in Garland v. Cargill. Under those principles, only the text of a statute is the law, which cannot be changed unless Congress amends it by enacting a new law. That means courts may never give precedence over the text to their own views of good policy or to their speculations about what policies are popular in Congress.

The National Firearms Act of 1934 places very stringent regulatory restrictions on machine guns, which Congress defined as any weapon that shoots “automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.” Because bump stocks like those at issue in the case now before the court require the shooter to release and then depress the trigger again after each shot, the government initially concluded that they do not turn a semiautomatic rifle into a machine gun. That conclusion was dictated by the unambiguous language of the statute, which requires that multiple shots be fired “by a single function of the trigger.”

Since bump stocks permit a semiautomatic firearm to achieve a rate of fire comparable to that of a machine gun, it’s perfectly understandable that the government would want to update the 1934 law. Congress has done that repeatedly, going so far as to freeze the supply of legally owned machine guns in the Firearm Owners’ Protection Act of 1986. But if there is one central tenet in the originalist principles of statutory interpretation, it is that only Congress, not the president or the Supreme Court, has the constitutional authority to amend statutes. Upholding the Trump reclassification would require a majority of the justices to repudiate that principle, whether they admit it or not. And for what? To spare Congress the trouble of enacting a simple and presumably popular fix?

The goal of the conservative legal movement has been to replace the result-oriented adventurism of the Warren court during the 1950s and 1960s with respect for the original meaning of the Constitution, including its allocation to Congress of the sole authority to enact and amend statutes. If the government wins either of these cases, let alone both, that movement should recognize that its project has not succeeded.","Sen.

Fox News' Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report.","Days before his hush money trial begins in New York, former President Donald Trump returns Saturday to the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania for a campaign rally that will be notable for who won’t be there – the expected Republican nominee for Senate, Dave McCormick.

Trump has been reluctant thus far to endorse McCormick, who is running unopposed in the GOP primary to take on Democratic incumbent Bob Casey in the critical Senate battleground. McCormick’s campaign told CNN the candidate has a previously scheduled family event, having made the commitment long before Trump announced his planned rally in Schnecksville in the Allentown suburbs.

The former president has so far endorsed all candidates backed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee in the major swing states, except in Pennsylvania and Nevada. (And while he has not yet formally backed a candidate in the Senate race in Nevada, he posted on social media Friday that Republican hopeful Sam Brown and the former president himself were the “Clear Choices of Nevada’s Republican Voters and Donors.”

Trump’s resistance to formally wade into the Pennsylvania Senate race has confounded some Trump allies, especially given that the former hedge fund CEO faces no primary opponents in the April 23 GOP primary.

One campaign adviser insisted to CNN, however, that while there wasn’t a jump to get behind McCormick, there wasn’t any dislike either: “We are going to eventually work with him, and we’re going to support him.”

People close to the former president say the lack of an early endorsement is not entirely surprising: Trump and McCormick have a fraught history, dating back to McCormick’s failed 2022 primary bid for Pennsylvania’s other Senate seat against celebrity heart surgeon Mehmet Oz.

As he campaigned for Senate in 2022, McCormick — no stranger to the former president given that his wife, Dina Powell, previously served as a deputy national security adviser to Trump — met privately with the former president in the hopes of an endorsement, or at least his neutrality in the primary.

But despite the overture, Trump ultimately endorsed Oz and bashed McCormick on the campaign trail in his attempts to elevate his chosen pick. Oz went on to win the Republican nomination by 951 votes after a recount but then lost the general election to Democrat John Fetterman.

At a May 2022 rally, Trump declared that McCormick was “not MAGA” and said he was “the candidate of special interests and globalists and the Washington establishment.”

This time around, McCormick has not reached out for Trump’s endorsement, a source close to McCormick told CNN. A Pennsylvania GOP operative acknowledged that the two would need to work together but said a Trump endorsement might not help McCormick as much as it would other Republican candidates, noting that, given McCormick’s history, he is unlikely to get the full support of Trump’s MAGA base and would need to draw from suburban and independent voters.

“They are very different people with very different profiles,” the operative said.

Trump recently seemed to acknowledge his differences with McCormick, arguing that the West Point graduate was not “pro-Trump,” according to a source with direct knowledge of the comment.

During a May 2023 event at the American Enterprise Institute, McCormick conceded that Trump could once again pose a threat if he sought public office again. McCormick said that his 2022 campaign didn’t think it needed Trump’s endorsement but also recognized that it “would be harder” to win if the former president “went negative” on his candidacy.

People close to the former president point to McCormick’s endorsement of Trump last month as a sign that he will eventually get Trump’s support. But they acknowledge that McCormick’s decision to remain neutral in the GOP presidential primary and not endorse until former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley had dropped out of the running hasn’t helped.

A ‘microcosm’ for the country
During the 2023 event, McCormick said he believed Pennsylvania is a “microcosm” for the country and argued that any successful GOP candidate must appeal both to the Trump loyalists in the Republican base, as well as to moderate Republicans, who still hold traditional conservative beliefs.

That’s a calculus that Trump’s team also faces as it looks to recreate his stunning 2016 victory in the Keystone State, which combined with his wins in Michigan and Wisconsin created a seismic crack in the so-called blue wall of states Democrats had relied on in every election going back to 1992.

Trump turns attention to Michigan and Wisconsin, the ‘blue wall’ states he won, then lost
Much of Trump’s success that year in those three states was attributed to his sway with blue-collar voters — a core bloc his 2024 campaign is actively courting once again ahead of November.

The campaign’s attempts to win all three states – which Joe Biden flipped in 2020 – will largely focus on messaging around the economy, inflation and immigration, Trump’s campaign advisers say. These themes are expected to play a prominent role in Trump’s Saturday remarks in Schnecksville.

The former president could also air his baseless claims of election fraud, both past and potential — a chief focus for his campaign and the Republican National Committee in 2024 and an issue Trump touted at length Friday during a joint news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort with House Speaker Mike Johnson. Trump regularly makes false claims about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, including the Pennsylvania result, and has promoted election-related conspiracy theories.

Biden carried Pennsylvania by 81,660 votes in 2020 out of nearly 7 million cast. That tight margin contributed to the presidential race being deemed too close to call on election night, and Biden was projected the state winner days later. This was largely due to the millions of mail-in ballots cast in Pennsylvania during the pandemic that did not begin to be counted until Election Day. That dynamic helped stoke disinformation and false claims of election fraud by Trump and his allies.

Recent polls have shown a tight presidential race in Pennsylvania between Trump and Biden. The pair were tied at 46% each in a CNN survey from last month.

Biden will be making his own campaign swing through Pennsylvania next week, during which he is expected to draw an economic contrast with his predecessor and tout his plans to raise taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations. Trump recently told donors he wants to extend the sweeping tax cuts that congressional Republicans approved in 2017.

A fraught time for Trump
Trump has been notably less active on the campaign trail in the weeks since he secured enough delegates to become the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. In that time, he has opted instead to mostly host and attend a series of private, high-dollar fundraisers as his team scrambles to close its big financial gap with Biden and the Democratic Party.

Trump will begin the day Saturday by traveling to Newtown in suburban Philadelphia for a fundraiser before heading north to Schnecksville in the Lehigh Valley.

While this is his first campaign rally in Pennsylvania in 2024, it’s not his first visit to the state this year.

The former president spoke at a National Rifle Association presidential forum in Harrisburg in February, and later made an appearance at Sneaker Con in Philadelphia to unveil a new sneaker line. The “Trump Sneakers” were unveiled a day after the former president and his companies were ordered by a judge to pay nearly $355 million – and an additional roughly $100 million in interest – in his New York civil fraud case. Trump had to post a $175 million bond as he appeals the verdict.

The timing of Saturday’s rally is significant, as it’s Trump’s last campaign event before jury selection begins Monday in his New York hush money trial. A Trump campaign adviser told CNN that, as of Friday evening, the former president’s prepared remarks for his Saturday speech do not include a heavy focus on the trial. However, Trump is notorious for speaking off the cuff at his campaign events — and many of his riffs center on grievances related to his legal troubles.

Trump has been preoccupied for days with his upcoming trial, sources close to the former president told CNN, a weekslong period that will see the former president taken off the campaign trail during a vital period for his White House bid.

The weekend will offer a preview of his team’s balancing act between the courtroom and the campaign trail — following the rally, Trump is expected to fly straight to New York City, where he will be prepared by members of his legal team on Sunday on court protocol and messaging, a source familiar with his plans told CNN.","SCHNECKSVILLE, Pa. — Former President Donald Trump backed former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick on Saturday in Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate race, after excoriating him two years earlier.

“I am officially giving my endorsement to David McCormick tonight,” Trump told the crowd. “He wants to run a good ship. He’s a smart guy who was a very successful guy. He’s given up a lot to do this. And I’ll tell you what, he’s the nominee of the Republican Party.”

McCormick, who is running unopposed in the April 23 GOP primary, is expected to take on Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in the general election. The swing state race could determine which party controls the Senate next year.

McCormick also ran in 2022 to replace retiring Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.). In that GOP primary, however, Trump endorsed celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, who lost to Democratic Sen. John Fetterman.

During the 2022 race, Trump blasted McCormick, calling him “the candidate of special interests and globalists and the Washington establishment.” According to McCormick, Trump refused to endorse him when he wouldn’t say the 2020 election was stolen.

McCormick, who has endorsed Trump, did not attend the Schnecksville rally but thanked Trump on social media for the endorsement. One of several self-funding Republicans running for U.S. Senate this year, he’s less in need of fundraising help from the former president than others.

Casey, who is seeking a fourth term, has won each of his previous bids by a comfortable margin. But the race is expected to be one of the closest and most expensive Senate contests this year.

At his Saturday night rally, Trump also seized the opportunity to address the strike Iran launched against Israel few hours earlier, claiming it “would not have happened” if he were president.

“I want to say God bless the people of Israel. They’re under attack right now,” he said. “We show great weakness.”

As Trump pledged U.S. support for Israel, the crowd chanted “genocide Joe” — a term used by pro-Palestinian demonstrators as a way of criticizing President Biden’s support for Israel in its war in Gaza.

Trump paused before saying: “They’re not wrong.”

But in the final days of his presidency, Trump downplayed an attack by Iran on U.S. bases in Iraq. Dozens of soldiers suffered traumatic brain injuries as a result.","Kamala Harris’s Friday visit to Arizona was planned before the state’s top court upheld a 160-year-old law that bans almost all abortions. But the news galvanized the vice-president’s message, one that has already yielded stunning victories for liberals since Roe v Wade fell nearly two years ago.

That message is simple: abortion bans happen when Republicans are in charge.

“Women here live under one of the most extreme abortion bans in our nation. … The overturning of Roe was without any question a seismic event, and this ban here in Arizona is one of the biggest aftershocks yet,” Harris said at the Tucson event. “Overturning Roe was just the opening act of a larger strategy to take women’s rights and freedoms … We all must understand who is to blame. Former president Donald Trump did this.”

The ruling from the Arizona supreme court arrived on Tuesday, just days after a Florida supreme court ruling cleared the way for a six-week abortion ban, a decision that will cut off access to the procedure before many women even know they are pregnant. These back-to-back rulings roiled the United States, raising the already high stakes of the 2024 elections to towering new heights. Activists in both states are now at work on ballot measures that would ask voters to enshrine abortion rights in their states’ constitutions in November.

Democrats are hopeful these efforts – and the potential threat of more bans under a Trump administration – will mobilize voters in their favor, because abortion rights are popular among Americans, and Republicans have spent years pushing restrictions. Democrats have made abortion rights a central issue of their campaigns in Arizona, which was already expected to be a major battleground, and Florida, a longtime election bellwether that has swung further to the right in recent years.

For Joe Biden, who is struggling to generate enthusiasm among voters, turning 2024 into a referendum on abortion may be his best shot at defeating Donald Trump. But it remains an open question whether the backlash to Roe’s overturning will continue to drive voters in a presidential election year, when they may be more swayed by concern over the economy and immigration.

“In public polls that might just ask: ‘What’s your most important issue?’ You’re going to see abortion in the middle, maybe even towards the bottom,” said Tresa Undem, a co-founder of the polling firm PerryUndem who has studied public opinion on abortion for two decades. “But when you talk to core groups that Democrats need to turn out, it’s front and center.”

A recent Wall Street Journal poll found that Trump held double-digit leads when swing state voters were asked who would best handle the economy, inflation and immigration, but they trusted Biden more on abortion. A Fox News poll in March found that most voters in Arizona believe Biden will do a better job handling the issue of abortion, but it was less of a priority than the economy, election integrity and foreign policy.

Arizona’s abortion ban is a political nightmare for Republicans in the 2024 election

For Biden, abortion is “the best issue for him right now”, Undem said. “All of the data I’ve seen on this upcoming election, young people are not nearly as motivated to vote as they were in 2020. And so in places like Arizona, the total ban – and I don’t make predictions ever – I do think it is going to turn out young people, especially young women.”

The Biden campaign has released two abortion-focused ads this week, including one that features a Texas woman who was denied an abortion after her water broke too early in pregnancy. (She ended up in the ICU.) Indivisible, a national grassroots organization with a local presence in states across the country, said volunteer sign-ups to knock on doors in Arizona spiked 50% following the state supreme court’s ruling. Its members in Arizona are helping to organize rallies in support of reproductive rights as well as events to collect signatures for the ballot measure.

When Roe fell, abortion rights’ grip on voters was far from guaranteed. Mitch McConnell, Senate Republicans’ longtime leader and an architect of the conservative supreme court majority that overturned Roe, brushed off outrage over its demise as “a wash” in federal elections. Although most Americans support some degree of access to the procedure, anti-abortion voters were more likely to say the issue was important to their vote than pro-abortion rights voters.

The fall of Roe changed that. Anger over Roe was credited with halting Republicans’ much-promised “red wave” in the 2022 midterm elections, while pro-abortion rights ballot measures triumphed, even in crimson states such as Kansas and Kentucky. Last year, when Virginia Republicans tried retake control of the state legislature by championing a “compromise” 15 week-ban, they failed. Democrats now control both chambers in the state.

“When Republicans offer compromises, I think a lot of voters are inclined not to see those as what the Republican party really wants long-term but what the Republican party thinks is necessary to settle for in the short term,” said Mary Ziegler, a University of California at Davis School of Law professor who studies the legal history of reproduction. “They know that Republicans are aligned with the pro-life movement and the pro-life movement wants fetal personhood and a ban at fertilization.”

In the hours after the Arizona decision, several Republican state lawmakers and candidates with long records of opposing abortion rushed to denounce the near-total ban (which has not yet taken effect). The Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake, who once called abortion the “ultimate sin” and said Arizona’s impending near-total abortion ban was “a great law”, attempted to clarify her position on the issue in a meandering, five-minute-plus video. The ban she once favored – which passed in 1864, before Arizona even became a state or women gained the right to vote – is now “out of line with where the people of this state are”, Lake said.

“The issue is less about banning abortion and more about saving babies,” she said, as instrumental music swelled against images of pregnant women and pregnancy tests. She repeatedly stressed the importance of “choice” – language associated with people who support abortion rights – while simultaneously invoking the value of “life”.

Lake also emphasized that she “agrees with President Trump” on abortion. Over the course of his campaign, Trump has alternated between taking credit for overturning Roe – since he appointed three of the justices who ruled to do so – toying with the idea of a national ban, and insisting that states can decide their own abortion laws, as he did in a video this week.

In that video, released on Monday, Trump declined to endorse a federal ban on the procedure, after months of teasing his support. On Wednesday, Trump criticized the Arizona law and predicted that state lawmakers would “bring it back into reason”. Florida’s six-week ban, he suggested, was “probably, maybe going to change”. He reiterated his criticism on Friday, posting on his social media platform that the Arizona supreme court went “too far” in upholding an “inappropriate law from 1864” and calling on the Republican-led state legislature to “ACT IMMEDIATELY” to remedy the decision. “We must ideally have the three Exceptions for Rape, Incest, and Life of the Mother,” he wrote. (The 1864 ban only includes an exception to save the life of the pregnant person.)

“He’s simply trying to have it, I think, both ways,” Ziegler said of Trump.

Come November, Democrats are counting on the real-world consequences of the bans overriding other concerns. “The economy is still important. Immigration is still important, but this is immediate,” said Stacy Pearson, an Arizona-based Democratic strategist.

“A woman just wants to be in her OB-GYN’s office, having a conversation with her doctor about her medical care without concerns about whether or not old white men in cowboy hats were right in 1864,” Pearson added. “It’s nuts.”","On Thursday, President Joe Biden took a giant step toward making us safer from gun violence by making it harder for someone who shouldn’t possess a gun to buy one. Next week will mark the 25th anniversary of the deadly massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado. The 13 victims murdered that day were killed by two students firing guns lawfully acquired without any background checks.

Since Columbine, many other mass shootings have been linked to guns purchased without the benefit of a background check, and lawmakers and officials have mightily struggled to eliminate this often fatal gap in gun safety, known as the gun show loophole. The new rules should take effect in one month. It’s not a moment too soon.

When the proposed changes were opened up for 90 days of public comments, two-thirds of the 400,000 responses favored the new rule.

The gun show loophole is sometimes called the “private sale exception.” That’s because it allows those who sell guns at private or informal settings, such as gun shows or flea markets, to do so without initiating the law enforcement background checks on their customers that are required of federally licensed gun sellers who often conduct business at brick-and-mortar firearms stores. The new rule, to be enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), redefines sellers required to conduct background checks as anyone “engaged in the business” of selling guns at a profit.”  Those sellers must now register as a federally licensed firearms dealer and submit buyers' data for criminal records and mental health queries even if they only deal in a small number of transactions.

The U.S. Justice Department noted that the new requirement will apply to more than 23,000 currently unlicensed dealers and cover tens of thousands of gun sales annually. That means thousands of gun sales previously conducted in a kind of double-blind transaction, with law enforcement in the dark as to whether the seller is a criminal or the buyer a potential mass shooter, will now be exposed to safety measures. Importantly, despite what naysayers might claim, the rule will not apply to selling private gun collections or passing on a grandfather’s old hunting rifle to his grandchild.

POOR PLANNING
Donald Trump and Mike Johnson just mixed two big lies together
Paul Waldman
This new regulation really isn’t new. It simply takes the existing background check requirements already mandated at gun stores and applies them equally at sales happening in other places. The criminal or adjudicated mentally ill customer who would be turned away at the gun store, will now be turned away at the gun show or flea market. This isn’t infringing on anyone’s Second Amendment rights; it’s just acting responsibly. Responsible gun owners don’t want their rights tainted by violent offenders who give them a bad name. In fact, when the proposed changes were opened up for 90 days of public comments, two-thirds of the 400,000 responses favored the new rule.


Biden proposes plan to close gun show loophole
02:06
You might think that this approach to increased gun safety makes perfect sense, and that it simply treats everyone equally, regardless of where they buy their gun. So, who would complain? Well, for starters, there are Republican Sens. John Cornyn, of Texas, and Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, who intend to introduce a joint resolution expressing disapproval and demanding that the new measures be overturned. Why would Cornyn, whose home state experiences almost 4,000 deaths by guns per year, and Tillis, who loses almost 1,300 of his constituents a year to gun deaths, not want safer communities?

According to Gallup, more than half of Americans think laws governing gun sales should be stricter. If certain members of Congress aren’t motivated by what their constituents want, perhaps they’re driven by their own self-interests. Tillis has been one of the top recipients of money from the National Rifle Association over the course of his career for more than $4 million so far. Cornyn has benefited from NRA funds to the tune of almost $80,000 over his tenure; a mere pittance compared to Tillis. But Cornyn has announced his intention to run for Senate GOP leader when Mitch McConnell vacates that position. Maybe Cornyn needs to take in as much NRA money as McConnell has — reportedly more than $1 million — if he wants to curry favor with his party and the NRA. It seems like some of our elected officials believe the threat of losing NRA money is greater than the present danger of constituents’ lives lost to gun violence.

The new mandated background check for gun show sales makes us safer. Our safety shouldn’t depend on where potential mass shooters buy their gun. And, our lives shouldn’t depend on how much money our Congress members get from the NRA.","Former President Donald Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records after being indicted by a Manhattan grand jury.

In court documents unsealed last year, prosecutors alleged Trump engaged in a ""scheme"" to boost his chances during the 2016 presidential election through a series of hush money payments made by others and the falsification of New York business records to cover up that alleged criminal conduct.

In a statement of facts accompanying the indictment, Manhattan prosecutors allege Trump made payments to his lawyer to reimburse him for a payment the lawyer made to one woman.

Trump, who has denied all wrongdoing, pleaded not guilty to all 34 counts.

Here is a timeline of the case, dating back to Trump's initial declaration as a candidate for president:

June 16, 2015
Trump announces he is running for president.

August 2015
Trump meets with David Pecker, then-chairman and CEO of American Media Inc. -- which owns the National Enquirer -- at Trump Tower in New York. Pecker agrees to help with Trump's campaign by looking out for negative stories about him to ""catch and kill,"" according to prosecutors' statement of facts. He also agrees to publish negative stories about Trump's competitors in the election, according to the statement of facts filed by the Manhattan DA.

October/November 2015
Pecker learns that a former Trump Tower doorman was trying to sell information that Trump allegedly fathered a child out of wedlock, according to the statement of facts. At the CEO's direction, AMI negotiates and signs an agreement to pay the doorman $30,000 in exchange for acquiring exclusive rights to the story. AMI allegedly falsely characterized this payment in its general ledger, according to the statement of facts.

AMI purchases the story without fully investigating the doorman's claims, at the direction of Pecker, per his alleged arrangement with Trump, according to the statement of facts. AMI later determines the story was not true and wanted to release the doorman from the agreement, but Lawyer A -- a Trump Organization lawyer believed to be Michael Cohen -- allegedly instructs him not to do so until after the presidential election, according to the statement of facts.

June 2016
The National Enquirer's editor-in-chief and chief content officer contacted Cohen (Lawyer A) about a woman -- who is believed to be Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who alleged she had had a sexual relationship with Trump while he was married, according to the statement of facts. Cohen (Lawyer A) is updated by the National Enquirer about this regularly over text and by phone, according to the statement of facts. Trump allegedly did not want this information to become public because he was concerned what impact it may have on his campaign for president, according to the statement of facts.

AMI ultimately pays the woman $150,000 in exchange for her not speaking out on the alleged sexual relationship. She would also get two magazine cover features and a series of articles published under her byline, according to the statement of facts.

Prosecutors allege that this deal was made based on the understanding that Trump or the Trump Organization would reimburse AMI for the payment, according to the statement of facts.

Trump has denied having the affair.

September 2016
An audio recording allegedly captures a conversation between Trump and Cohen (Lawyer A) as they discuss how to obtain the rights to the woman's story from AMI and reimburse it for the payment, according to the statement of facts.

Cohen (Lawyer A) allegedly tells Trump he will open a company for the transfer of the woman's account and said he had spoken to Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg about setting it up, according to the statement of facts.

A shell company -- called Resolution Consultants, LLC -- is allegedly set up on about Sept. 30, 2016. On or about that date, Pecker signs an agreement transferring the rights of the woman's account to the shell company owned by Cohen (Lawyer A) for $125,000, according to court documents. But, before the reimbursement was made, Pecker consulted AMI's general counsel and then told Cohen (Lawyer A) that the deal was off.

Oct. 7, 2016
News breaks that Trump was caught on tape in 2015 telling the host of the entertainment show ""Access Hollywood,"" ""I just start kissing them [women]. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the [genitals]. You can do anything.""

According to prosecutors, evidence shows that both Trump and his campaign staff were concerned the tape would harm his viability as a candidate and reduce his standing with female voters in particular.

In a statement Trump released after the recording was leaked, he apologized and called his remarks ""locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago.""

Oct. 10, 2016
AMI's editor-in-chief contacts Pecker about a second woman -- believed to be adult film actress Stormy Daniels -- who alleged she had a sexual encounter with Trump while he was married, according to the statement of facts. Pecker tells the editor-in-chief to notify Cohen (Lawyer A).

The AMI editor-in-chief connects Cohen (Lawyer A) with the woman's lawyer. The two then negotiate a deal to secure the woman's silence. The woman would be paid $130,000 for the rights to her story, according to the statement of facts.

Trump allegedly tells Cohen (Lawyer A) to delay making a payment to the second woman for as long as possible, according to prosecutors. If he is able to delay making the payment until after the election, they could avoid paying altogether, Trump allegedly says, per prosecutors. Prosectors claim emails and text messages between both lawyers and the AMI editor-in-chief show they attempted to delay making the payment for as long as possible, according to the statement of facts.

Ultimately, Trump agrees to the payoff and directs Cohen (Lawyer A) to proceed, prosecutors allege. Trump allegedly does not want to make the payment himself and asked Cohen (Lawyer A) and Weisselberg to find a way to make the payment, according to the statement of facts. Cohen (Lawyer A) makes the payment after confirming that Trump would pay him back.

Oct. 26, 2016
Shortly after speaking with Trump over the phone, Cohen (Lawyer A) opens a bank account in Manhattan in the name of a shell company he had created to effectuate the payment, according to the statement of facts.

Cohen (Lawyer A) then transfers $131,000 from his personal home equity line of credit into the account, according to court documents.

Oct. 27, 2016
Cohen (Lawyer A) transfers $130,000 to a lawyer representing the second woman accusing Trump of having a sexual encounter with her while he was married to suppress her story, according to court documents.

Nov. 8, 2016
Trump wins the presidential election.

AMI then releases the doorman and the first accuser of their nondisclosure agreements, according to court documents.

By Jan. 20, 2017
Prosecutors allege that between Election Day and Inauguration Day, Trump meets privately with Pecker in Trump Tower in Manhattan, thanking him for handling the stories of the doorman and the first woman, according to the statement of facts.

Trump invites Pecker to the inauguration, according to the statement of facts.

January 2017
Trump arranges to reimburse Cohen (Lawyer A) for the payoff he made on his behalf shortly after being elected president, according to the statement of facts.

Cohen (Lawyer A) meets with Weisselberg to discus how he would be reimbursed, with Weisselberg asking Cohen to bring a copy of a bank statement for the shell company account showing the $130,000 payment, according to the statement of facts.

MORE: The Manhattan DA's investigation into Trump and the Stormy Daniels hush payment, explained
Weisselberg and Cohen (Lawyer A) agree to a total repayment amount of $420,000. That figure reflected double the $130,000 payment and $50,000 reimbursement for another expense in addition to a $60,000 year-end bonus -- so Cohen (Lawyer A) could characterize the payment as income on his tax returns instead of a reimbursement -- according to the statement of facts.

Trump, Weisselberg and Cohen (Lawyer A) agree the lawyer would be paid the $420,000 through 12 monthly payments of $35,000 over the course of 2017, according to court documents. Cohen (Lawyer A) was to send an invoice to the Trump Org each month falsely requesting a payment of $35,000 for legal services rendered. Cohen (Lawyer A) does not have a retainer agreement with Trump or the Trump Organization, according to prosecutors.

February 2017
Cohen (Lawyer A) meets with Trump in the Oval Office to confirm the repayment arrangement in February 2017, according to the statement of facts.

Feb. 14, 2017
Cohen (Lawyer A) emails the Trump Organization the first monthly invoice requesting two $35,000 payments for January and February, which were allegedly approved by Weisselberg, according to the statement of facts.

Throughout 2017
Cohen (Lawyer A) submits 10 similar invoices for the remaining months in 2017, but is not on retainer, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors allege the Trump Organization falsely recorded each payment as a ""legal expense,"" according to the statement of facts.

According to prosecutors, the first check was paid from Trump's trust and signed by Weisselberg and Trump's son, as trustees. It was falsely recorded as payments for January and February 2017 legal services, according to the statement of facts.

A second check, for March 2017, was also paid from the trust and signed by two trustees, according to the statement of facts.

The remaining nine checks, for April through December 2017, were paid by Trump personally, according to the statement of facts. Trump allegedly signed each of the checks personally and had them sent to the Trump Organization in New York. They were then scanned and maintained in its data system before being detached and mailed to Cohen (Lawyer A), according to the statement of facts.

The last $35,000 payment made was for December 2017, according to the statement of facts.

Summer 2017
Trump invites Pecker to the White House for dinner to thank him for his help during the campaign, according to the statement of facts.

April 9, 2018
The FBI executes a search warrant on Cohen's residences and office, according to a statement of facts. Prosecutors allege that in the months that followed, Trump and others engaged in a public and private pressure campaign to try to ensure that Cohen did not cooperate with law enforcement in the federal investigation.

Cohen (Lawyer A) speaks with Trump on the day of the FBI searches, according to prosecutors. Trump allegedly told him to ""stay strong,"" according to the statement of facts.

April 21, 2018
Trump publicly encourages Cohen not to ""flip"" in a series of tweets saying, ""Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't see Michael doing that.""

Mid-April 2018
Cohen (Lawyer A) is approached by an attorney -- Lawyer C -- who offers to represent him in the interest of maintaining a ""back channel of communication"" to Trump, according to the statement of facts.

On April 21, 2018, Lawyer C allegedly emails Cohen (Lawyer A) stating that he has a close relationship with Trump's personal attorney, named as Lawyer D, according to the statement of facts.

June 14, 2018
Lawyer C emails Cohen (Lawyer A) a news clip discussing the possibility of him cooperating with law enforcement, encouraging him not to, according to the statement of facts.

""The whole objective of this exercise by the [federal prosecutors] is to drain you, emotionally and financially, until you reach a point that you see them as your only means to salvation,"" Lawyer C wrote in the email, according to the statement of facts.

In the same email, Lawyer C wrote, ""You are making a very big mistake if you believe the stories these 'journalists' are writing about you. They want you to cave. They want you to fail. They do not want you to persevere and succeed,"" according to the statement of facts.

July 2, 2018
In an in-depth interview that airs on ""Good Morning America,"" his first since the FBI raided his office and homes in April, Cohen strongly signals his willingness to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York -- even if that puts Trump in jeopardy.

""My wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will,"" Cohen tells ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. ""I put family and country first.""

Aug. 21, 2018
Cohen pleads guilty in the federal investigation admitting to his role in AMI's payoff to McDougal (Woman 1) to influence the election, according to the indictment, and saying in his plea that he had done so at Trump's direction.

Cohen also pleads guilty in connection with his payoff of Daniels to secure her silence, claiming it was done at Trump's direction, according to the statement of facts.

Trump comments on Twitter saying, ""If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen!""

September 2018
Cohen and AMI admit guilt in connection with the payoffs made to the two women claiming Trump had extramarital relations with them, according to the statement of facts.

AMI entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in connection to the payoff made to Woman 1, admitting it did not intend to publish a story at any time during the negotiation or acquisition of her story, the practice known as ""catch and kill,"" according to the statement of facts.

Nov. 3, 2020
After a bitter campaign for reelection, Trump goes head to head with Joe Biden on Election Day. Four days later, it's clear Trump has lost after ABC News projects Pennsylvania for Biden.

March 2021
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance announces he will not seek reelection after 12 years in office, with the investigation into Trump still ongoing. His office had begun to look into hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels in 2018.

Nov. 2, 2021
Alvin Bragg is elected district attorney in Manhattan. Once in office, he picks up the investigation into Trump.

Bragg had led the investigation into the Trump Foundation in 2017 under then-Attorney General Eric Schneiderman for ""extensive unlawful political conduct"" with the charity's money and using it for personal matters. The foundation was dissolved and Trump was forced to pay $2 million as part of a settlement in 2019.

Nov. 4, 2021
Vance convenes a new grand jury for six months to hear evidence against Trump, paving the way for it to last until after he leaves office in January.

The grand jury that was already convened was set to expire. It had voted to bring charges against the Trump Organization and its CFO, Weisselberg, on unrelated matters.

Jan. 1, 2022
Bragg takes office as Manhattan's new district attorney. Before leaving office, Vance does not bring charges against Trump.

Feb. 22, 2022
The two prosecutors leading the Trump probe -- Assistant District Attorneys Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz -- resign from the district attorney's office.

Pomerantz later reveals that he disagreed with Bragg's decision to not bring charges against Trump in Bragg's early days as DA. Pomerantz was formerly a special prosecutor with the Southern District of New York.

The investigation continues after their resignations but doubt is cast on whether charges will be brought against Trump.

Aug. 18, 2022
Weisselberg pleads guilty to tax evasion, admitting he avoided taxes on nearly $2 million in income in a yearslong scheme. He agrees to a plea bargain for five months in prison and to testify against the Trump Organization at the upcoming trial in October. But, the plea agreement does not require him to testify against Trump himself.

Dec. 5, 2022
Bragg announces he has hired Matthew Colangelo as senior counsel. He was a previous Department of Justice official and prior to that worked at the New York Attorney General's Office where he was part of the team that investigated the Trump Foundation.

Dec. 6, 2022
A jury finds the Trump Organization guilty on all counts of tax fraud brought by the Manhattan district attorney's office.

Charges included scheme to defraud, conspiracy, criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records.

Beginning of 2023
A grand jury has been hearing testimony about the hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, sources tell ABC News, including testimony from Pecker, the longtime Trump confidant. The DA's office also has the cooperation of Cohen.

Jan. 18, 2023
In a letter to book publisher Simon & Schuster, Bragg says he is concerned an upcoming book about Trump written by Pomerantz could harm the district attorney's office's investigation. Bragg asks the publisher to delay its release by asking for 60 days to review its manuscript.

Pomerantz's publisher says the book will be published in February as planned.

Jan. 30, 2023
Pecker becomes one of the first people to testify in front of the reconvened grand jury as it investigates hush money payments to Daniels.

Feb. 7, 2023
Simon & Schuster releases Pomerantz's book, ""People vs. Donald Trump: An Inside Account,"" in which he criticizes Bragg, saying Bragg made a mistake by not bringing a case against Trump at the beginning of his tenure. Pomerantz had been assigned to the case by Vance.

Bragg responds to the criticism, saying the case against Trump wasn't ready.

Feb. 8, 2023
Cohen meets with prosecutors investigating Trump in what is his 15th time meeting with the district attorney's office, but his first since the grand jury was convened.

March 13, 2023
Cohen again testifies before the grand jury investigating the hush money payments.

March 20, 2023
Bob Costello, an attorney who says he previously advised Cohen, tells reporters his former client has a ""lie, cheat, steal"" mindset after Costello testifies for the defense before the Manhattan grand jury investigating Trump's role in the hush payment to Daniels.

Costello, a longtime Trump ally, appears before the grand jury as an exculpatory witness after Trump's legal team asked the DA to allow him to testify, according to a letter to prosecutors obtained by ABC News.

""I'm trying to tell the truth to the grand jury,"" Costello tells reporters after testifying. ""If they want to go after Donald Trump and they have solid evidence, then so be it. Michael Cohen is not solid evidence.""

March 27, 2023
Pecker speaks to the grand jury again for about an hour, according to sources familiar with the matter. The district attorney's office may have called Pecker to bolster Cohen's earlier testimony about the purpose of the payment.

March 30, 2023
The Manhattan grand jury hands down an indictment against Trump, making him the first former or current president to be indicted. The indictment remains under seal so it's not immediately clear what Trump will be charged with, but he negotiates his surrender, saying he will travel to New York the following week.

April 3, 2023
Trump travels to New York City from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida home, one day ahead of surrendering to the court. He spends the night at his apartment in Trump Tower.

April 4, 2023
Trump travels to the Manhattan courthouse from midtown Manhattan to be processed by authorities before heading to court for his arraignment and the unsealing of the indictment.

The former president pleads not guilty to 34 felony charges of falsifying business records stemming from his hush payment to Daniels. Prosecutors allege that he engaged in a ""scheme"" to boost his election chances during the 2016 presidential race through a series of hush money payments made by others to help his campaign, and then ""repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records"" to conceal that criminal conduct.

Trump immediately returns to Mar-a-Lago where he gives a speech to supporters the same night criticizing Bragg for bringing charges and adding, ""We are a nation in decline, and now these radical left lunatics want to interfere in elections by using law enforcement. We can't let that happen.""

April 12, 2023
A threatening letter containing white powder is sent to Bragg, the second since Trump started posting on social media about his impending indictment. There are no reports of injuries or illness.

Bragg himself has received ""multiple"" death threats since Trump's indictment, police sources tell ABC News.

April 17, 2023
Prosecutors say the judge overseeing the criminal case against Trump should ask one of his attorneys for additional information about a potential conflict of interest.

Trump’s defense team includes Joe Tacopina, an attorney Daniels once considered hiring to represent her, and the Manhattan district attorney’s office says Tacopina’s representations so far are insufficient. Trump affirmed at his arraignment he wanted to move forward with Tacopina on his legal team, but Susan Hoffinger, the executive assistant district attorney, said a full hearing would be needed.

The potential conflict was raised by Daniels’ current attorney, Clark Brewster, who said in a letter to the Manhattan district attorney’s office Daniels had a 2018 conversation with Tacopina and lawyers at his firm.

Tacopina has said he never spoke to Daniels and he told the judge his firm refused to represent her.

May 8, 2023
Judge Juan Merchan, the New York City judge overseeing Trump's criminal case, imposes a protective order against Trump that is meant to ensure evidence shared by the DA's office doesn't wind up on the internet.

Prosecutors had sought the protective order because of what they called Trump's ""extensive history"" of making inflammatory remarks about witnesses, prosecutors and others associated with legal matters pending against him, assistant district attorney Catherine McCaw said when seeking the order.

May 24, 2023
Judge Merchan sets a trial date of March 25, 2024, for Trump's criminal trial on charges of falsifying business records. He had previously indicated that no one associated with the case is allowed to schedule anything that would conflict with the trial.

The judge also reviews for Trump the terms of the protective order that prohibits him from sharing on social media any evidence turned over by the Manhattan district attorney during discovery.

June 2, 2023
Attorneys for Trump ask Judge Merchan to step aside, citing the judge's daughter's ties to a Democratic organization.

The defense says the judge can't be impartial because his daughter is an executive at Authentic Campaigns, a Democratic consulting firm that worked on President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign.

Merchan himself will decide whether he is impartial.

Trump tries in a new court filing to get his criminal prosecution in New York moved to federal court, arguing the alleged crimes ""took place while the president was in office.""

Trump's attorneys accuse the Manhattan district attorney's office of ""deceptively mischaracterizing and ignoring the applicable facts and body of law"" by seeking to keep the case in state court.

June 27, 2023
A federal judge seems disinclined allow Trump to move his criminal prosecution in New York into federal court.

Stormy Daniels is ""set to testify"" in Trump's Manhattan hush money trial set for March 25, the adult film actress says on the most recent episode of her podcast.

Feb. 15, 2024
In the case's final hearing before the trial gets underway, Judge Juan Merchan -- with Trump in attendance -- denies Trump's motion to dismiss the case and shoots down arguments from the defense that the trial should be delayed because it will interfere with Trump's campaigning for president.

Feb. 26, 2024
DA Alvin Bragg asks a judge to impose a limited gag order barring Trump from making public statements about witnesses, jurors, court staff and prosecutors other than Bragg involved in the case, citing what he calls Trump's ""longstanding and perhaps singular history"" of attacking people he considers to be adversaries.

Feb. 29, 2024
Prosecutors plan to use Trump's own words -- including quotes from books like ""Trump: The Art of the Deal"" -- against him in his hush money trial, according to court filings.

March 4, 2024
Trump's defense lawyers ask Judge Juan Merchan to deny prosecutors' request for a limited gag order, arguing the former president should be permitted to fully respond to attacks by his political opponents.

March 5, 2024
The public release of the infamous 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape before the 2016 presidential election ""served as the catalyst"" for Trump's hush payment to Stormy Daniels and should be admissible at his upcoming trial, prosecutors argue in a court filing.

March 6, 2024
Trump's attorneys, in a filing, accuse Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of pursuing a ""deluded fantasy"" case against the former president by tying a hush payment to an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election.

March 7, 2024
Judge Merchan agrees with the DA's request to limit the disclosure of the names and other identifying information of jurors in the upcoming trial, finding ""there is a likelihood of bribery, jury tampering, or of physical injury or harassment of juror(s).""

Attorneys for Trump ask Judge Merchan to delay the start of the trial while the U.S. Supreme Court weighs Trump's presidential immunity argument -- but the judge pushes back, criticizing the timing of the request and ordering Trump's team to seek permission before making future motions.

March 12, 2024
Attorneys for Trump say in a court filing that they will not invoke a formal ""advice of counsel"" defense at the trial, but signal that Trump will argue he did not intend to break the law ""because of his awareness that various lawyers were involved.""

March 14, 2024

March 21, 2024
Trump's request for a lengthy adjournment of his hush money trial based on recently disclosed potential evidence is ""a red herring"" and part of a ""strategic delay,"" prosecutors argue in a court filing.

Stormy Daniels, meanwhile, tells ABC's ""The View"" that she is ""absolutely ready"" to testify at trial.

March 25, 2024
Judge Juan Merchan orders the trial to begin with jury selection on April 15. The decision rejects a bid by Trump's attorneys to further delay the case after the defense raised issues with the late production of over 100,000 pages of potential evidence by federal prosecutors.

March 26, 2024
Judge Merchan grants the Manhattan district attorney's request for a limited gag order on the former president that prevents Trump from making public statements about witnesses in the hush money case, prospective jurors, members of the court staff and their families other than the judge, and lawyers in the case other than Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg.

The partial gag order follows Trump's disparaging remarks about witness Michael Cohen, Judge Merchan, and Merchan's daughter, who works with a group involved in Democratic politics.

April 1, 2024
Judge Merchan expands his limited gag order on Trump to cover the family members of the judge and District Attorney Alvin Bragg, following a request by prosecutors after Trump continues to target Merchan's daughter on social media.

The development comes as sources tell ABC News that Trump's former spokesperson Hope Hicks is expected to testify for the prosecution at the upcoming trial.

The ruling comes on the same day the Manhattan DA's office urges the judge to reject Trump's attempt to delay the upcoming trial due to the large amount of pretrial publicity.

April 5, 2024
Judge Merchan quashes a subpoena issued to NBCUniversal by defense lawyers that had sought materials related to their documentary about Stormy Daniels, calling the request the ""very definition of a fishing expedition.""

April 8, 2024

The development comes on the same day that Judge Merchan releases the questionnaire he plans to use to oversee jury selection for the trial. ABC News, meanwhile, reports that prosecutors at the upcoming trial are expected to call several witnesses who are or were part of Trump's inner circle.

April 9, 2024
Appellate Judge Cynthia Kern declines Trump's request to delay the upcoming trial while waiting for the full panel of the Appellate Division First Department to weigh, later this month, whether to relax Trump's limited gag order.

April 10, 2024

Three days before the scheduled start of the trial, Judge Merchan denies Trump's request to adjourn the case due to overwhelming pretrial publicity.","During a campaign stop in Las Vegas on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris will promote Nevada's ballot measure to enshrine abortion access in the state constitution.

The Biden-Harris campaign will help collect signatures for the ballot initiative, a Biden-Harris campaign official told CBS News. In Nevada, the initiative is being led by Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom political action committee. If enough signatures are obtained, Nevadans will get to vote during the general election on enshrining abortion access for up to 24 weeks in the state's constitution.

According to the campaign official, Vice President Harris will encourage Nevada voters to support the efforts, as they are ""an important step to protect against extremist state lawmakers who may try to adopt another 'Trump abortion ban' in the future.'""

As of early April, Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom announced the collection of over 110,000 signatures ahead of the June 26 qualification deadline. In order to be on the 2024 ballot, 102, 362 signatures must be submitted. Of those, 25,591 must come from each of Nevada's four congressional districts.

The political group said it was actively collecting signatures from all districts. 

""With more than 110,000 signatures gathered in less than six weeks, it's a true testament to the fact that Nevadans recognize the importance in codifying reproductive freedom into our state constitution,"" said president Lindsey Harmon.

Harris' trip to Nevada marks her second campaign stop focused on abortion rights in 2024, as abortion continues to be a mobilizing issue for Democrats. It also comes on the heels of the vice president's trip to Arizona on Friday after the state's supreme court upheld an 1864 law that severely restricts abortions. 

""Former President Donald Trump did this,"" Harris told her crowd in Tucson. ""Donald Trump is the architect of this healthcare crisis.""

In Nevada, Harris is expected to once again blame abortion bans on Trump and warn voters that a second-Trump term would put women's reproductive freedoms at risk. According to Harris, Trump, if elected for a second term, would sign a national abortion ban. 

Harris will make her reelection case in Nevada while joined by Arizona state Senator Eva Burch.  

Also on Monday, Amanda Zurawski of Texas and Kaitlyn Joshua of Louisiana will appear at a Wisconsin event for the Biden-Harris campaign. Both women will tell their personal stories of how their lives were impacted by restrictive abortion laws in their states after the overturning of Roe v. Wade.","Former President Donald Trump isn’t charged with making a $130,000 payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement, but for allegedly falsifying business records to hide the payment.

In addition, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg elevated the charges from misdemeanors to felonies by alleging they were connected to other criminal activity, which he didn't specify. One option for the additional crime Bragg outlined is a campaign finance violation because buying Daniels’ silence before the 2016 election could have influenced the outcome.

Bragg described the payments to Daniels and another woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, as part of a “catch-and-kill” strategy to prevent the women from telling their stories. But the criminal charges are that Trump falsified his company’s business records to conceal the payments.

""The core is not money for sex,"" Bragg said in a radio interview in December. ""We would say it's about conspiring to corrupt a presidential election and then lying in New York business records to cover it up.""

Former U.S. President Donald Trump attends the first day of his trial for allegedly covering up hush money payments at Manhattan Criminal Court on April 15, 2024, in New York City. Former President Donald Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first of his criminal cases to go to trial.
Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, has testified to Congress he arranged the payment to Daniels and Trump reimbursed him a total of $420,000 for the payment, his tax liability and a bonus, through a series of monthly $35,000 payments.

Cohen pleaded guilty and served time in prison on a campaign finance violation as part of a broader federal case. Contributions to federal campaigns from individuals are strictly limited to a few thousand dollars per person.


Trump has said the payments were a retainer for Cohen’s services, which Cohen denied in sworn testimony. Trump also argued he was paying for a non-disclosure agreement, a private contract that had nothing to do with the campaign.

Trump tweeted in May 2018 that Cohen ""received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign,"" as reimbursement for ""a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement.""","Home | Newsmax TV

Alan Dershowitz to Newsmax: Trial Starting 'Unfairly' for Trump
By Charlie McCarthy    |   Monday, 15 April 2024 11:38 AM EDT

Comment|Print|    A   A
The beginning of former President Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York City on Monday went ""unfairly,"" as was expected, legal scholar Alan Dershowitz told Newsmax.

Dershowitz appeared on ""National Report"" shortly after the trial began. Trump is charged with falsifying business records to pay a former adult film star to keep quiet before the 2016 election about an alleged extramarital affair.

Judge Juan Merchan denied Trump's request for a recusal in the case, and said he would allow the prosecution to enter new evidence involving the ""National Enquirer,"" according to Newsmax’s Jon Glasgow.

Merchan also said he would ask potential jury members two questions: Whether they're unable to serve due to conflict, and whether they do not believe they can serve in an impartial way, Glasgow added.

""It's going as it thought it would, very unfairly against Trump,"" Dershowitz told co-hosts Shaun Kraisman and Emma Rechenberg. ""The questions that are being asked of the jurors are absurd.

""They're asking the jurors, 'Can you be fair?' What juror in his right mind would ever say, No, I can't be fair. The question should not ask the jurors anything about their own ability to render a fair verdict. That's a decision that should be made only after extensive examination about the facts.""

Dershowitz continued"" ""What have you heard about Trump? What have you said about Trump? What have people told you about Trump? Have you expressed views about Trump? These are the issues.

""Don't ask a juror whether it can be fair. Of course, a juror will always say they can be fair if they want to serve on the jury. If they don't want to serve on the jury, they'll say, No, they can't be fair, even if they could be fair.""

The Harvard Law School professor emeritus went on to say that Trump may get convicted despite this being ""the weakest [case] I've seen in 60 years of teaching and practicing and writing about criminal law.""

""It may well result in a conviction because of jury selection and because the jurors are picked from the pool, 85% of whom voted against Donald Trump and probably hate Donald Trump and are going to try to hide that hatred in order to get on the jury to convict him,"" Dershowitz said.​"
"Bret Stephens: Good news, bad news, Gail. The economy added just over 300,000 new jobs last month, which gives Joe Biden something to brag about. But illegal immigration is now the No. 1 concern for voters, according to a story in The Wall Street Journal, and in one February poll 65 percent of Americans disapproved of Biden’s handling of the border.

You still feeling chipper about the president’s chances this year?

Gail Collins: Yep. It’s one thing to be cranky about the state of the union. It’s another to want to hand it over to a multiply indicted jerk who is supposed to go on trial this month for paying hush money to a porn star, followed by cases involving everything from stashing classified documents in the bathroom to criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election.

Well, I could go on and on. And the cases will go on and on. Voters are going to have to pay attention, and that’s going to give Biden the election.

Feel free to torture me if I turn out to be wrong.

Bret: I pray you’re right. But you have more faith in the wisdom of the American people than I do. I’m with H.L. Mencken on the presidency: “As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. … On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart’s desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.”

Adorned a second time, I should say.

Gail: If Biden were running against a right-wing stranger, maybe I’d agree. But the country knows Trump, and I’m betting a majority realizes that what they’d be getting with his return would be pretty unpleasant.

Bret: Memories get awfully short once you reach the trillionth tweet.

Gail: Every time we talk about this stuff, I feel that it’s all about new forms of communication. If the country were just listening to critiques of the Biden administration from the mass media of right, middle and left, we’d be in a different world. Not saying we should go back there, just that now people have the chance to vent their feelings to hundreds of thousands of strangers. It creates a whole different megaconversation.

Bret: A nation of self-important dunderheads, venting.

Gail: Truly, Bret, if Trump had been president for the last few years, do you think there’s any chance people wouldn’t be posting even greater outrage?

Bret: You’ve raised a couple of points that I often think about. The first is the way that social media has hastened the return of mob politics. It has the same combination of anonymity and mass, of the direct interface between the leader and his “followers,” of the absence of context that newspapers used to provide, of immediacy and rage amplification. No wonder Trump was such a master of the medium.

The second is that, of all the many reasons I don’t want Trump back in office, his presidency will once again unleash all the left-wing furies that Biden’s presidency has largely calmed. With Trump back in the White House, I can easily see half of America looking much the way Portland, Ore., did in the summer of 2020. Trump isn’t the scourge of wokeness; he’s its rocket fuel.

Gail: You’ll forgive me if worry about a resurgence of liberal-left politics isn’t something that dissuades me from anti-Trumpism.

Bret: For me, it’s just another reason to oppose him.

Gail: But about immigration and the economy: I’ll start with the economy — and so, I strongly suspect, would practically every Democratic officeholder in the country. I know politicians aren’t supposed to lecture people about how great their lives are, but it’s weird that the nation doesn’t seem more conscious of how well things are going.

There are plenty of jobs available. Prices have generally stabilized or begun to drop. Even though it’s true those prices are still higher than they were before the Covid era — and you can’t expect the average shopper to be cheery when the price of eggs keeps going up. (Thank you, bird flu.)

My bottom line is that Biden can justly claim that things have gotten much better for American consumers, but he’s gonna have to do some real campaigning to persuade the voters. All the while pressuring businesses to restrain their greed.

Bret: It isn’t just avian flu and the price of eggs. The median asking rent when Biden became president was just over $1,600. Three years later, it’s close to $2,000. A 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.7 percent when Biden was inaugurated. Today: 6.8 percent. A basket of groceries that would have cost $100 just before the pandemic now costs $125. The fact that the rate of inflation is finally coming back down to normal — although it’s not there yet — doesn’t mean people don’t feel pinched. And even though wages are starting to catch up with inflation, it feels like a case of running to stand still.

Truth is, the economy is nowhere as bad as Republicans claim — but not close to great, either. And the immigration crisis infuriates people, because the administration let it happen, then denied it was happening and now blames others for its continuing to happen. It just feels like a failure of government at its most basic level of responsibility. I don’t expect Biden to admit he was wrong, but he’s got to do more to show that he gets that it’s a huge problem.

Gail: Sorry, Congress was prepared to pass a perfectly reasonable immigration bill supported by the administration. Then it was killed at the last minute because Trump started howling.

Bret: That’s true. But Biden got serious only when the problem was already out of hand.

Gail: I’d never argue a total solution to all immigration issues is at the doorstep, but that was a good plan to move in the right direction, which included a solid increase in the border police presence. Republicans chickened out because their next presidential candidate doesn’t want anything to get better while he’s not in office.

Bret: True again. But blaming Trump and his minions for being Trumpy isn’t going to absolve the administration of its mistakes — like Kamala Harris declaring in 2022 that “the border is secure” — or, more important, move the political needle for Biden. He needs to use his executive powers to do something dramatic, like deploying thousands of troops to the border and finding legal ways to expand their powers of arrest.

Can I switch the subject? Ron DeSantis just signed a law that basically forbids kids under the age of 14 from having social media accounts. Is this Big Brother in action or sanity at last?

Gail: Really good question, and the fact that I’m even considering a DeSantis attention grabber anything but a play for right-wing headlines demonstrates how worrisome this stuff can be.

I know I’ve told you that when I was a kid a millennium or so ago ——

Bret: Just half a millennium, Gail.

Gail: All the girls I knew were obsessed with a telephone tree that featured critiques from boys our age and gossip among the girls who tried to be insiders by thinking of catty things to say about their former friends.

Now the idea that you could hear reports on who said what on the phone was so traumatic for us — I just can’t conceive of what it would be like for young people who have to read that kind of look-at-me backbiting online.

On the other hand, do we feel kids under 14 shouldn’t share their thoughts about the world around them? I’m torn. Tell me what to think.

Bret: I’m almost always for free speech and I’m usually against intrusive nanny-statism. But this time, DeSantis is right, for the same reason it’s right to make it illegal for kids to buy cigarettes or alcohol: Social media isn’t just a means of communication. It’s a mechanism for addiction and a recipe for destruction.

Gail: OK, continue depressing me.

Bret: The social psychologist Jonathan Haidt notes in his new book, “The Anxious Generation,” that there is a striking correlation between the birth of social media and the iPhone around 10 to 15 years ago and a long list of psychological and social pathologies among adolescents, from sleep deprivation to suicide. I’d love to think parents can do it alone, but sometimes families need help from the state to stop something that is otherwise as damaging as it is ubiquitous.

There, we did it: We had a nice thing to say about the governor of Florida.

Gail: There has to be something wrong here. I’ll sleep on it.

Bret: And before we go, Gail, we’re having this conversation on the eve of the big solar eclipse. Any deep thoughts on this stellar event — assuming it isn’t too cloudy to see it — coming so soon after our itty-bitty earthquake last week?

Gail: Not my job, Bret. This calls for a man with a poem. C’mon.

Bret: A literary friend of mine introduced me to this beauty by Archilochus of Paros, who lived 27 centuries ago. It’s a reminder of all the transcendent natural experiences that connect us, as human beings, over time, distance, religion and culture — and of how the Greeks always said it best.

Nothing will surprise me anymore, nor be too wonderful
for belief, now that the lord upon Olympus, father Zeus,
dimmed the daylight and made darkness come upon us in the noon
and the sunshine. So limp terror has descended upon mankind.
After this, men can believe in anything. They can expect
anything. Be not astonished any more, although you see
beasts of the dry land exchange with dolphins, and assume their place
in the watery pastures of the sea, and beasts who loved the hills
find the ocean’s crashing waters sweeter than the bulk of land.","House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., says former President Donald Trump is ""100% with"" him as he faces a barrage of attacks from members of his own party, most notably Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to oust him from his leadership position.

""I spent hours with the president on Friday. He and I talked frequently…. He's 100% with me, and he said, 'We'll get this job done.'"" Johnson told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on Sunday.

""What Marjorie's done with a motion to vacate is not helpful for our party, for our mission to save the country,"" he continued. ""Because if we don't grow the House majority, keep the House majority, win the Senate, and win back the White House for President Trump, we are going to lose the Republic.""

Johnson's remarks come days after his notable press conference with the former president and current presidential nominee at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, where the pair addressed a slew of pressing issues facing the nation today.

Johnson insisted Sunday that this year's election will be the ""most important"" of everyone's lifetime, pointing to a handful of key issues repeatedly highlighted by Republicans – open borders, out-of-control spending, weakness on the world stage, the weaponization of government and the burdensome cost of living.

As members of the GOP remain fixated on the border security issue, the House speaker has come under fire from those like Greene who allege he is failing to do enough to ensure that border security is a top priority.

Appearing on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" last month, the Georgia congresswoman explained her rationale behind the motion.

""If Speaker Johnson really wanted to secure the border like he promised all of us, he would promise the American people that he would have told Chuck Schumer, 'We will not pass any government funding bills until our border and funding bills have the H.R. 2 in it, or the Laken Riley Act, or at least some measures within them, but he didn't. He completely failed in that,"" she said.

Johnson has previously stated that he understands Greene's concerns and recently expressed plans to communicate with her.

On Sunday, he told Bartiromo that Greene ""fails to notice"" that House Republicans have been fighting on the border issue.

""We fight on it every day. We passed our comprehensive border security package, H.R. 2, at the very beginning of this Congress. It's been sitting on Chuck Schumer's desk. We passed all the resolutions. We passed these acts out of the House, and they get stopped in the Senate,"" he said.

All the while, Johnson insists keeping the party united should remain a priority for Republicans to ensure a victory in November.

""Our party needs to stay united. We need to go out and tell the American people how we'll be different, not just what we're against, but what we're for, what our agenda is going to be and how we're going to turn this country around. I'm absolutely bullish on the election cycle. I think we're going to do that,"" he added.","Donald Trump and Joe Biden remain locked in a close race for the presidency, according to a new poll from the New York Times and Siena College, which finds registered voters nationwide splitting 46% for Trump to 45% for Biden with no clear leader in the contest.

That’s a tighter race compared with the last Times/Siena survey in late-February, when Trump led by 5 points, but is in line with the current CNN Poll of Polls average, which shows 48% supporting each candidate with the new poll incorporated. At the time of the last Times/Siena poll, the Poll of Polls averaged 48% Trump to 46% Biden, suggesting a narrower shift in overall views of the race since early March compared with the change in this specific poll.

The survey finds that how the public views the state of the country remain largely unchanged: Most voters still say the US is heading in the wrong direction (64%), Biden’s approval rating remains deeply negative (38% approve and 59% disapprove), and ratings of the economy are far more bad than good (79% rate economic conditions as only fair or poor).

The polling comes as Biden prepares a campaign swing through battleground Pennsylvania while he looks to draw an economic contrast with Trump, zeroing in on his plans to raise taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations. His team has emphasized what they see as bright spots in the economy, including low unemployment, wage gains and an overall downward trend in inflation from its highest point earlier in the administration.

The former president, meanwhile, has also leaned into his economic plans on the campaign trail. Trump told a crowd at a recent fundraiser in Florida – at which he raised $50.5 million – that one of his core issues for a second term would be extending the sweeping tax cuts that congressional Republicans approved in 2017.

Trump, who is also expected to participate in a campaign rally and donor event in Pennsylvania on Saturday, will begin a juggling act between the courtroom and the campaign trial as his criminal hush money trial kicks off on Monday.

More broadly, 54% say they feel that Trump has committed serious federal crimes, 37% that he has not, about the same as in the February Times/Siena poll.","The Democratic governor of Kansas vetoed a bill Friday that would have banned gender-affirming care for minors, setting up a confrontation with the state’s Republican supermajority as it tries to join more than a dozen states restricting transgender care.

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.
The Republican-led legislature is widely expected to attempt an override of the veto. The measure that Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly (D) quashed, Senate Bill 233, would ban hormone therapy, puberty blockers and gender reassignment surgery for people younger than 18.

Carrie Rahfaldt, a spokeswoman for Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins (R), told The Washington Post that she expects the Senate to begin voting sometime after a veto session begins April 29.

If two-thirds of the Senate votes to pass the bill, the measure would be kicked to the House, which also requires a two-thirds majority for an override. Hawkins said in a statement Friday that “House Republicans stand ready to override [the] veto to protect vulnerable Kansas kids.”

Kansas has 40 Democrats and 85 Republicans in its House and 11 Democrats and 29 Republicans in its Senate. The bill passed the House 82-39, and the Senate 27-13, largely along party lines. To override the veto, the House would need to add two yes votes and the Senate would not be able to lose any.

The success of the vote in the part-time legislature largely depends on attendance.

“Absences will change the number that they need to reach,” said Don Haider-Markel, a political science professor at the University of Kansas. “People have to leave and go home or some work-related or family-related issue. So, it very well could be that they don’t have enough votes in both chambers to override the veto.”

Kelly wrote in her veto message that she rejected the bill because it “tramples parental rights,” a phrase often used by conservatives to defend book restrictions at public libraries and schools.

“This divisive legislation targets a small group of Kansans by placing government mandates on them and dictating to parents how to best raise and care for their children,” Kelly said. “The last place that I would want to be as a politician is between a parent and a child who needed medical care of any kind. And, yet, that is exactly what this legislation does.”

House Republican leadership decried the veto.

“As we watch other states, nations, and organizations reverse course on these experimental procedures on children, Laura Kelly will most surely find herself on the wrong side of history with her reckless veto of this common-sense protection for Kansas minors,” Hawkins said in the Friday statement.

Last year, Kelly vetoed four bills that would have created restrictions on transgender people, including measures barring transgender girls and women from joining female K-12 and college sports teams, and ending the state’s legal recognition of transgender people’s gender identities. Republicans overrode vetoes on three of those measures, according to the Kansas City Star.

A record number of bills targeting transgender people have made their way through state legislatures in recent years. Lawmakers have introduced nearly 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills during the 2024 legislative session, according to data compiled by the American Civil Liberties Union. By May 2023, legislators had introduced more than 400 such bills, compared with about 150 in 2022, according to The Washington Post.

Many of these bills target gender-affirming care for minors, the use of restrooms and other facilities such as locker rooms, pronouns and drag shows, according to the ACLU. Oklahoma, Missouri, Iowa and Tennessee have introduced the highest share of anti-LGBTQ+ bills this year, according to the ACLU.

In January, Ohio’s Republican supermajority banned gender-affirming care for minors, overriding Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s December veto of the bill. The law prohibits hormone therapy, puberty blockers and gender reassignment surgery for people younger than 18. The measure also bans transgender girls from playing on sports teams designated for girls and women in high school and college.

Like Ohio’s bill, Kansas’s S.B. 233 would ban gender-affirming care for transgender youths. The bill also would restrict the use of state funds for gender-affirming care; ban the use of state property, including the University of Kansas Medical Center, on such care; and bar state employees who work with children from promoting or advocating for gender-affirming care. Under the measure, any health care provider who violates the ban would have their license revoked.

Major medical organizations such as the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychological Association and the Endocrine Society oppose restrictions on gender-affirming care. The American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have said gender-affirming care for transgender children is “medically necessary.”

Advocacy organizations warned state legislators that the “the bill’s extreme reach could have unintended consequences.”

“We cannot overstate the harm this bill will cause to some of our most vulnerable Kansas children and their families,” D.C. Hiegert, LGBTQ+ fellow of the ACLU of Kansas, said in a statement after the veto. “This bill attacks parents’ rights to access life-saving healthcare for their kids and threatens Kansas medical providers. And it is written so broadly, it could impact spaces like schools, therapist offices, or state agencies like the Kansas Department of Children and Families — and possibly every person who provides any kind of support or services to children in those places, as well as the youth who need them.”

Haider-Markel, who has written books about transgender rights and politics, predicts that the bill would prompt parents of transgender children to move out of the state to seek medical care.

The legislation would upend “the lives of young people and their families and really, I think, encourages many families with trans members to think about leaving the state because of the way in which they’ve targeted their families,” he said.

","A federal judge in Delaware refused on Friday to throw out a federal gun case against Hunter Biden, rejecting the president’s son’s claim that he is being prosecuted for political purposes as well as other arguments.

OJ Simpson was acquitted of charges he killed his former wife and her friend but later found liable in a separate civil trial.

The US district judge Maryellen Noreika denied defense efforts to scuttle the prosecution charging Hunter Biden with lying about his drug use in October 2018 on a form to buy a gun that he kept for about 11 days.

Hunter Biden’s lawyers had argued the case was politically motivated and asserted that an immunity provision from an original plea deal that fell apart still held. They had also challenged the appointment of the special counsel David Weiss, the US attorney in Delaware, to lead the prosecution.

Noreika, who was appointed to the bench by Donald Trump, has not yet ruled on a challenge to the constitutionality of the gun charges.

Hunter Biden faces separate tax counts in Los Angeles alleging he failed to pay at least $1.4m in taxes over three years while living an “extravagant lifestyle”, during his days of using drugs. The judge overseeing that case refused to dismiss the charges this month.

Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases. A representative for his legal team didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

The president’s son has acknowledged struggling with an addiction to crack cocaine during that period in 2018, but his lawyers have said he didn’t break the law and another nonviolent, first-time offender would not have been charged.

The defense attorney Abbe Lowell had argued Hunter Biden was “selectively charged” for improper political purposes. He argued that Weiss “buckled under political pressure” to indict the president’s son amid criticism of the plea deal from Trump and other Republicans.

Noreika said in her ruling that Biden’s team had provided “nothing concrete” to support a conclusion that anyone actually influenced the special counsel’s team.

“The pressure campaign from congressional Republicans may have occurred around the time that special counsel decided to move forward with indictment instead of pretrial diversion, but the court has been given nothing credible to suggest that the conduct of those lawmakers (or anyone else) had any impact on special counsel,” the judge wrote. “It is all speculation.”

","Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is no recent convert to Donald Trump’s gospel of the Big Lie; after the 2020 election, Johnson led 100 House Republicans in filing an amicus brief supporting an effort to invalidate the results of four swing states President Joe Biden won. So it was little surprise to see him standing next to Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, trying to link election conspiracy-mongering to immigration fear-mongering.

Johnson and Trump were there to propose new legislation restricting noncitizen voting, even though it is already illegal and incredibly rare. The speaker spun out a familiar and ugly fiction, claiming that as part of a plot engineered by Democrats, huge numbers of immigrants are entering the U.S. illegally and registering to vote. Democrats, Johnson said, “want to turn these people” — undocumented immigrants — “into voters.” This is a version of the white supremacist “Great Replacement” theory, which says that there is a conspiracy afoot to bring in a wave of nonwhite foreigners to replace the people Tucker Carlson calls “legacy Americans.” 

As long as election denial is a requirement for winning a GOP nomination, the party will continue to nominate weak candidates.

The continued effort by Trump and his allies to convince rank-and-file Republicans that any election they don’t win must be fraudulent is a profound threat to American democracy. But there’s another aspect to it that has gotten much less attention: As a political strategy, it’s absolutely harebrained.

As we saw in 2020, when courts continually rejected Trump’s efforts to stop election counts or get results overturned, these attempts never succeed beyond making election workers’ lives miserable. Whether it was Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, or anywhere else, Trump tried and failed to get his losses overturned, and if and when he does the same in 2024, he’ll fail again. 

Nevertheless, he has succeeded in persuading Republicans that the election system can’t be trusted. Polls show as many as 70 percent of Republicans say Trump was the true winner of the 2020 election. Every Republican politician understands how committed their voters have become to that fantasy, and so fealty to Trump’s election lies has become the test of whether you’re a “real” Republican.


Nowhere to hide: Donald Trump set to be held to account in first criminal trial of an ex-president

The result is that the party keeps nominating election deniers who alienate the independent voters (and even some moderate Republicans) they need to win. In the 2022 Senate contests, extremist Republicans such as Kari Lake, Blake Masters and Herschel Walker lost winnable races. As long as election denial is a requirement for winning a GOP nomination, the party will continue to nominate weak candidates. And in states, like Arizona and Michigan, the entire Republican Party apparatus has been all but driven into the ground by election deniers who care more about their conspiracy theories than winning elections.

Another complication for Republicans comes in the fact that their denialism obsession is making it harder for their own voters to cast ballots. Trump has spent the last few years telling his supporters that “mail-in voting is totally corrupt” and “if you have mail-in balloting, you automatically have fraud.” When they believe him, they deprive themselves of an easy and convenient way to cast their ballots. Party officials are trying to organize mail-in voting drives, but they run up against the skepticism their own leader never stops promoting.

Trump may or may not believe his lies himself, but it’s hard to imagine most of the Republican politicians lining up behind him actually do.

That’s just one aspect of a broader problem that could prove disastrous for Trump: All the talk of stolen elections could lower turnout among his supporters. After all, what’s the point of voting if it’s all rigged anyway?

This is particularly important for Trump because of a transformation in voting patterns that has occurred over the last decade. For years, higher turnout tended to benefit Democrats because of their support among those who vote only sporadically: lower-income and minority populations, young people, renters who move frequently, and so on. But that’s no longer true. Now it’s the Democrats who are outperforming in low-turnout elections, and Republicans who need the occasional voters to mobilize.

GUN SAFETY
Republicans can’t stand the idea of Biden closing the ‘gun show loophole’
Frank Figliuzzi
As one recent poll found, “among respondents who voted in the 2018, 2020 and 2022 general elections, Biden outpaced Trump 50 percent to 39 percent. But among respondents who were old enough to vote but voted in none of those three elections, Trump crushed Biden 44 percent to 26 percent.” If a candidate is doing better among people who don’t usually vote, he’ll have to work harder to get them to the polls, and election denialism only makes that task more difficult. 

It’s possible that repeating the stolen election lie will mobilize some Trump voters by making them angry; some may even believe the lunatic claims about undocumented immigrants rushing to fill out voter registration forms. But at the same time, relitigating a previous election, rather than offering something for the future, probably turns off voters in the middle in far greater numbers.

Trump may or may not believe his lies himself, but it’s hard to imagine most of the Republican politicians lining up behind him do; the rest agree because they feel they have no choice. But whichever category Mike Johnson falls into, he will continue to demonstrate his loyalty by repeating those lies, as well as the rancid fear-mongering about immigrants his party always believes is the key to victory. If he didn’t, then he wouldn’t be speaker for long. 

One has to suspect that even Johnson knows that putting so much focus on bogus claims of fraudulent votes and stolen elections is an absolutely disastrous electoral strategy. But it’s what Trump demands, so Johnson and the rest of the party will obey — no matter how many elections they lose.","A rush transcript of ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"" airing on Sunday, April 14, 2024 on ABC News is below.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's bring in the president’s top communications adviser on national security, John Kirby.

John, thanks for joining us this morning.

What's your assessment of the situation right now?

JOHN KIRBY, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNICATIONS ADVISER: Well, obviously, an extraordinary night with extraordinary results. An unprecedented attack on Israel, met with an unprecedent sense of resolve and determination and military capability. But not only by Israel, but by the United States and other partner nations. Truly a successful night. And due to a lot of skill, a lot of professionalism, and a lot of coordination across the board, I mean the Israel – Israel succeeded in defending itself and the United States certainly made good our commitment to help them do that.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you believe the conflict has been contained?

KIRBY: That's going to – I think we're going to have – we’ll know a little bit more in coming days. As the president has made clear, we – everything he's been doing since October 7th has been to try to keep this from becoming a wider regional war. And he prepositioned forces, even in the last few days, destroyers and fighter squadrons into the region to help Israel defend itself, to keep it from becoming a wider war, to keep it from escalating further.

So, we'll, obviously, be vigilant to any threat coming forward, and – and making sure that – that we're meeting that need.

STEPHANOPOULOS: The president also called on Iran not to retaliate, but they did anyway. What does that tell you?

KIRBY: Well, again, what it tells me – as I looked at it last night, what it tell mess is that we can make good on our commitment to defend Israel. It tells me that Israel does have superior military capability. Just think about the hardware that Iran threw into the sky and how little damage that caused. I mean that’s a real testament to how strong the IDF is.

It also tells me, and it should tell everybody else, that Israel’s not alone. That this was a coalition put together to help Israel defend itself. Iran is just increasingly further isolated in the region.

STEPHANOPOULOS: But walk us through the president's conversations with Netanyahu. Is he still warning him against escalation in Gaza? And what was his direct message on this proposed retaliation from Iran?

KIRBY: The main message was, we're with you. You know, he congratulated the prime minister on anextraordinary achievement and success last night, but also to reiterate that the United States is going to continue to help Israel defend itself. That's a commitment going back many, many administrations and the president believes wholeheartedly in it.

And obviously the president was interested in getting the prime minister’s perspectives on what happened. I won't get ahead of what the prime minister and the war cabinet will or won't do, but the president and the prime minister had a good discussion largely about the extraordinary success of last night.

Again, look, as I said earlier, the president has been very clear, publicly so. We don't seek a war with Iran. We don't seek an escalated re -- tensions in the region. We don't seek a wider conflict, and everything he's been doing literally since the 7th of October has been designed to that outcome.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Last night, former President Trump called President Biden a demented tyrant, adding that Israel wouldn't have been attacked on his watch.

Your response?

KIRBY: I won't get into the comments from the campaign trail, George. You know I can’t do that.

But think about this, the commander-in-chief, President Biden, the first one to go to war in the midst of the war, just after October 7th, on the ground, while Israel was still reeling with the effects of October 7th, on the ground there. And this president ordered U.S. forces actively to participate in the defense of Israel, actively shooting down missiles and drones from the sea and from the air.

I mean, that's extraordinary. That's leadership. That's leadership not just in the world, but it shows the power of American leadership around the world.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And what's the latest on the negotiations for hostage release and possible ceasefire?

KIRBY: Still ongoing -- well, actually, the negotiations, they wrapped up a week or so in Cairo. What I meant ongoing, what I meant is the exchange of information is still ongoing.

There is a proposal on the table that was arrived at with very careful diplomacy with our Israeli counterparts, led by the CIA Director Bill Burns. It's on the table.

Hamas needs to take that table. It’s a good deal. It will get those hostages out, at least the first tranche, elderly, sick, women. And it ill give us what will be about a six-week ceasefire to allow for an increase in humanitarian assistance.

It's time now to move that forward. It's up to Hamas. We want them to take that deal.

STEPHANOPOULOS: John Kirby, thanks very much.

KIRBY: Thank you.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And we're joined now by Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota.

Thank you for joining us this morning, Senator.

You know, we just heard what’s happening in Arizona based on this Comstock law. You’re leading an effort in the House to repeal it. Any prospects for success?

SEN. TINA SMITH, (D) MINNESOTA: Well, you know, first of all, I just want to say, George, that American women are not going to be conned by Donald Trump and his comments about abortion. We know that he is the one who is responsible for what's going on in Arizona and all over the country. So, that's the bottom line, I think, as we think about the election coming up.

With regard to the Comstock Act, OK, so this is a 150-year-old law that has been long relegated to the dust bin of history, and yet we can see Trump judges, and even the United States Supreme Court, raising this up as a reason why people shouldn't be able to get medication abortion through the mail. So, we have to pay attention to this and make sure that we are doing everything that we can to protect people's rights to make their own decisions about their own bodies and their own lives.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Is there anything more that President Biden could be doing now with executive action to protect those rights?

SMITH: I'm really grateful that the president has done everything that he possibly can to protect people's rights. And he is fighting right now to make sure that the FDA's authority to make decisions about whether medications like Mifepristone are -- that their decision-making is what rules and not the decision of some Trump judge from Texas, which is what's happening before the Supreme Court right now.

So I think that they're doing everything that they can. What we need to do is to win these elections so that we can put the protections of Roe in law.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You say that the American people will not be conned by Donald Trump, but his position now is relatively clear, isn't it, saying this should be a state by state issue?

SMITH: Well, so think about what that means exactly. First of all, he said that he is the person who is proudly responsible for overturning Roe. That is what has caused all of this chaos and cruelty to the one in three American women who live in states where abortion is now basically banned.

The other thing he said just a couple of days ago is that these state bans are working the way they should. So ask a woman in Arizona or Texas whether she thinks this is working for her. Because, for her, this isn't a political discussion. This is about her personal life and her decisions that she can make for herself about her own life.

So I think that his position is totally clear. He is responsible for these abortion bans, and I think he's going to be held accountable for that come the election in November.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Given what you think is the power of this issue and everything else we've seen over the course of this election, how do you explain the fact that Donald Trump is either tied or ahead of President Biden in most polls?

SMITH: Well, you know, there's so much talk about these polls right now. I've been working -- you know, I started out in politics working as an organizer and going door to door, talking to my community. And so I know that what matters is the choice that people are faced with when they actually cast their vote. And that is what's going to make all the difference in the world.

And on this issue, on the issue of abortion rights, the choice couldn't be more clear, right? You have Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who are fighting to protect people's freedom, and Donald Trump, who's responsible for taking it away.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Smith, thank you for your time this morning.

SMITH: Thank you.

STEPHANOPOULOS: We're joined now by New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, who worked against Donald Trump during the primaries, has now endorsed the former president.

Governor, thank you for joining us this morning.

GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU, (R) NEW HAMPSHIRE: You bet.

STEPHANOPOULOS: History being made tomorrow, that criminal trial. Will your support for Donald Trump continue even if he's convicted in Manhattan?

SUNUNU: Yeah, look, this -- this trial is not going to have major political ramifications that a lot of people, I think, think it may have. And when it comes to these issues, people see it more as reality TV at this point. They really do. And so, you know, whether it's a conviction or what that conviction looks like, a lot of folks, they conflate all four of these different trials that he's in.

I don't think it's good that he's going to be in the court, have to be in there probably three days a week, you know, for a number of weeks. That takes him off the campaign trail. He'll probably go back on the campaign trail and almost, like, rehash what's going on. He'll try to victimize it. And that has worked for him, right? I mean, this has been going on for over a year, and his poll numbers never seem to go down because of the issue.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, yeah, you're going to politics, though. I'm asking you about right and wrong. You think it's -- you're comfortable with the idea of supporting someone who's convicted of a federal crime as president?

SUNUNU: Oh, no. No -- I don't think any American is comfortable with any of this. They don't like any of this, of course. But, I mean, when it comes to actually, you know, looking at each of these trials, as they, kind of, take place whether it's this year or next year, or as they, kind of, line up, right now this is about an election, right? This is about politics. That's what people are judging this on. And the ultimate, you know, decision will be -- will be in November, to see where people are.

But for months, and even over a year, we've heard that these are the things that are going to bring Donald Trump down. It's not. And to think that the American public is going to be massively swayed by this, politically or otherwise, that's -- that's not going to happen. If anything --

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: I’m asking whether you’re going to be swayed by it.

SUNUNU: Yeah --

STEPHANOPOULOS: I mean, you're a governor.

SUNUNU: No, no.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You're an elected official. I’m asking whether you're going to be swayed by it.

SUNUNU: Yeah. Look, nobody should be shocked that the Republican governor is supporting the Republican president.

Do you know what the real story is? The average American that has gone from Biden back to Trump, the average American that is feeling inflation and all these other issues that says, look, do all this -- whether there's a conviction or not, we want a culture change in Washington, D.C., and we'll continue to support the former -- former President Trump.

That's the real story, right? That Trump is leading in the polls across America in a lot of these different polls.

So, no one should be surprised by my support. What -- I think the real discussion is, you know, America's moving away from Biden. That's how bad Biden has become as president. There's just no doubt about it, right?

You can't ignore inflation. You can't ignore the border and say that these issues in the courthouse are going to be the one thing that brings Biden back into office. It's not going to happen that way.

STEPHANOPOULOS: As you mentioned, this is one of only several indictments the former president is facing. Perhaps the most consequential one, of course, related to January 6th.

Right after that January 6 attack, I want to put this up on the screen, you said: It is clear that President Trump's rhetoric and actions contributed to the insurrection. The domestic terrorists who attacked the United States Capitol must be held accountable and prosecuted.

Do you stand by that statement?

SUNUNU: A hundred percent, of course. They have to be prosecuted, and they are being prosecuted. That's good.

I think he -- his actions absolutely contributed to that. There's no question about that. I hate the election denialism of 2020. Nobody wants to be talking about that in 2024.

I think all of that was absolutely terrible, but what people are going to be voting for, what I -- what -- the reason I’m supporting not just the president, but the Republican administration. That's what this is.

They want a culture of change in Washington, all the rules and policies that pound down on the American people. All the wokeness, right? The fact that folks in Washington, liberal elites in Washington want to stand on the shoulders of hardworking American families that built this country, defended this country and tell them how to live their lives.

They're angry. They're upset. That's the culture change that people want to see.

People are upset by January 6th. They're upset by the election denial. They have every right to be -- I am -- but at the end of the day, they need a culture change to get America back on track.

STEPHANOPOULOS: So -- but wait a second right there. Your words were very, very clear on January 11th, 2021. You said that President Trump’s rhetoric and actions contributed to the insurrection.

No other president in American history --

SUNUNU: Yes.

STEPHANOPOULOS: -- has contributed to an insurrection.

So, please explain, given the fact that you believe he contributed to an insurrection, how you can say we should have him back in the Oval Office?

SUNUNU: It's not -- because for me, it's not about him as much as it is having a Republican administration -- Republican secretaries, Republican rules, a sense where states' rights come first, individual rights come first, parents’ rights come first.

We’re going to have a pro-business economy. We’re not going to have a cancel culture that has really infiltrated all across America.

It's not about Trump with me. It’s about bringing those more live free or die --

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: But he will be the president. You’re saying --

SUNUNU: I’m the governor of the live free or die state, bringing that mentality back.

STEPHANOPOULOS: That doesn't make any sense to me, Governor. I’m sorry. You're saying it's not about Trump. You’re saying -- he would be the president, and you’ve said he’s an insu -- somebody who’s contributed to an insurrection.

SUNUNU: I understand it doesn't make sense to you, George, but look at the polls. What you’re telling me is you don't understand why 51 percent of this country is supporting Donald Trump.

They're not crazy. They're not MAGA conservatives. They're not extremists. They want culture change. So, I appreciate --

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor, I’m not talking -- I’m not talking --

SUNUNU: The bigger issue is --

STEPHANOPOULOS: I’m not talking about polls. I’m asking you a very simple question. You believe Donald Trump contributed to an insurrection. That's correct, right?

SUNUNU: I stand by the statement.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You stand by the statement that he contributed to an insurrection.

SUNUNU: Look, his words -- he -- his words --

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: And you believe that someone -- you believe that a president who contributed to an insurrection should be president again?

SUNUNU: As does 51 percent of America, George. I mean, really.

I understand you're part of the media. I understand you’re in this New York City bubble or whatever it is, but you’ve got to look around what's happening across this country. They’re not -- it's not about just supporting Trump. It’s getting rid of what we have today.

It's about understanding inflation is crushing families. It's understanding that this border issue is not a Texas issue. It's a 50-state issue, right, that has to be brought under control.

It's about that type of elitism that the average American is just sick and tired of. And it's a culture change. That's what I’m supporting. That's what most of America right now is looking to support, and wants to change there.

That’s -- so, again, I know you're shocked that the Republican governor is supporting a Republican president and the Republican ticket, but it's about the ticket. It's about up and down the ballot, right?

I want Republican governors and senators and congressmen, and that type of culture, if you will. I keep going back to that because that's exactly what it is. That's the change America is looking for.

STEPHANOPOULOS: I’m --

SUNUNU: And they’re not relitigating January 6th. It's not a top issue.

If you ask the average American, is January 6 a top issue and you go on the ballot box, not even in the top five. It doesn't mean it’s not -- it wasn’t a significant point, doesn’t mean we weren't extremely disappointed by his words and actions, doesn’t mean we -- you know, that we tap into this election denialism, which I believe very -- very -- I think it's terrible what he's done on the election denial.

But again, it's not a top issue. People are voting on what's happening in their homes, what's happening with inflation, what's happening on the border, right? That's real, and that's what they're going to vote for, so --

STEPHANOPOULOS: So, you're against the election denialism which the president -- former president repeated last night. You believe he contributed to the insurrection on January 6th. You believe it doesn't matter if he's convicted in the Manhattan case.

He's also facing another indictment over classified documents. Previously, you've said these charges are serious and Trump should drop out of the race if he's convicted. Do you still believe that?

SUNUNU: Well, look, in a primary -- look, we fought hard in the primary. We got behind Nikki. This is the chaos that Nikki Haley and I and others warned about was going to follow Trump. That it's just a complete distraction. I would rather have Republicans on the campaign trail talking about real issues than, you know, having to talk about this stuff. It's a complete distraction.

It doesn't mean he's going to lose and it doesn't people aren't going to support the Republican ticket because, right now, it looks like they are. But, that's the distraction we're all trying to avoid.

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: But, I'm asking you a different question. I'm asking you a different question. I'm asking you a different question because you said in the past that he should drop out if he's convicted in the classified documents case. Do you still believe that?

SUNUNU: No. No. No. He's going to drop out after being the nominee? Of course, not. You know, that's not to be expected at all. All of these cases, by the way, the average American, it's on conflated, right? We watched this stuff. We watch the details. The average American sees it more as a reality TV. I am not saying it's not -- there not real issues to bear there, of course there are. But, there's clearly politics to bear in some of these cases, that is undeniable.

The average American just thinks it's more reality TV and prosecution of him at this point. He plays that victim card very, very well. His poll numbers only go up with this stuff. So to think that this is some sort of deal breaker, again, I'll go back to where I started where people are going to say, yep, if he's convicted I'm walking away. That's just not going to happen. At the end of the day, they want that culture change of the Republican Party, and if we have Trump as the standard bearer -- and the voters decided that's what they wanted, not what I wanted, but what the voters -- what the Republican voters wanted, he's going to be the standard bearer that we'll it take it if we have to. That's how badly America wants a culture change.

STEPHANOPOULOS: So just to sum up, you would support him for president even if he is convicted in classified documents. You would support him for president even though you believe he contributed to an insurrection. You would support him for president even though you believe he's lying about the last election. You would support him for president even if he's convicted in the Manhattan case. I just want to say, the answer to that is yes, correct?

SUNUNU: Yes, me and 51 percent of America.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor, thanks for your time this morning.","CBS News and 11 other major news organizations on Sunday issued a joint statement urging President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump to commit to debates during the 2024 campaign season. 

In the letter, the news organizations said it was too early for invitations to go out to candidates for debates, but that it wasn't too early for presidential candidates who expect to meet eligibility criteria to publicly state their commitment to debates in the fall.

""If there is one thing Americans can agree on during this polarized time, it is that the stakes of this election are exceptionally high,"" the organizations said in the joint statement. ""Amidst that backdrop, there is simply no substitute for the candidates debating with each other, and before the American people, their visions for the future of our nation.""

ABC News, The Associated Press, CNN, C-SPAN, FOX News Media, NBCUniversal News Group, NewsNation, Noticias Univision (Univision Network News), NPR, PBS NewsHour and USA TODAY joined CBS News in signing the joint statement. 

The Republican National Committee voted unanimously in 2022 to ban future GOP presidential nominees from participating in debates put on by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, the body that has sponsored general election debates since 1988.

Trump campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita addressed the Commission on Presidential Debates in a letter on Thursday, saying that Trump was willing to debate. They did not address the 2022 GOP vote, but they did call on the commission to be fair and impartial.

""Fairness in such a setting is paramount and the Commission must ensure that the 2024 Commission-sponsored debates are truly fair and conducted impartially,"" they wrote. ""The Commission must move up the timetable of its proposed 2024 debates to ensure more Americans have a full chance to see the candidates before they start voting, and we would argue for adding more debates in addition to those on the currently proposed schedule.""

Trump, who avoided debating his GOP rivals in primary debates, previously faced some criticism for failing to show up to those debates and face questions on stage alongside other Republican candidates. But in a December interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump suggested he'd be up for 10 debates with Mr. Biden. He also discussed debating with President Biden in a Thursday post to Truth Social.

""Biden can't speak,"" Trump said. ""Biden can't debate, Biden can't put two sentences together.""

At a Saturday rally in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, Trump had two podiums set up on stage. He spoke to the crowd from one podium and left the other empty except for a placard reading, ""Anytime. Anywhere. Anyplace."" He pointed to the lectern partway through his campaign speech. 

""See the podium? I'm calling on Crooked Joe Biden to debate anytime, anywhere, any place. Right there,"" Trump said. ""And we have to debate because our country is going in the wrong direction so badly and while it's a little bit typically early we have to debate.""

President Biden, when asked on March 8 if he would commit to a debate with Trump, said that ""it depends on his behavior."" The president previously addressed a potential debate in early February while visiting Las Vegas. After being told that Trump wanted to debate him as soon as possible, Mr. Biden said, ""If I were him, I'd want to debate me too.  He's got nothing else to do.""","WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a lower court’s ruling that a Black Lives Matter protest organizer can be sued by a police officer injured by an unknown assailant, a decision affecting the First Amendment right to protest.

The court turned down an appeal from DeRay Mckesson, a Black Lives Matter activist, who said he should not be held personally liable for the assailant’s actions.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the denial is not an expression of which side has the better case. Instead, Sotomayor said the appeals court in Louisiana should take into account a Supreme Court decision issued in a different case, Counterman v. Colorado, that could impact this one.

""I expect them to give full and fair consideration to arguments regarding Counterman's impact in any future proceedings in this case,"" Sotomayor wrote.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans last year said the injured officer has a plausible argument that Mckesson ran the protest in a way that made it likely there would be a violent confrontation with police.

Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union, which is defending Mckesson, argued the appeals court’s decision violates the First Amendment and a 1982 Supreme Court decision about damages caused during boycotts of white merchants led by the NAACP.

In a supporting brief, the NAACP said that throughout the Civil Rights Movement, the court rejected attempts by segregationists to suppress political activity through criminal charges and civil suits.

The appeals court decision, the NAACP said, “invites harassment and silencing of today’s civil-rights activists and leaders.”

Civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson walks to the lectern to speak during the ""End Racism Rally"" on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of civil rights leader Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on the National Mall in Washington, U.S., April 4, 2018.
After the appeals court ruled, the Supreme Court decided a different First Amendment case about a man sentenced to more than four years in prison in Colorado for sending threatening Facebook messages. The court said prosecutors used too tough a standard to convict Billy Counterman. Prosecutors, the justices said in a 7-2 decision, must show a defendant acted recklessly, meaning the person ""disregarded a substantial risk that his communications would be viewed as threatening.""

Mckesson had asked the Supreme Court to confirm that that decision meant the suit against him could not move forward.

""Because this Court may deny certiorari for many reasons, including that the law is not in need of further clarification, its denial today expresses no view about the merits in Mckesson's claim,"" Sotomayor wrote. ""Although the Fifth Circuit did not have the benefit of this Court's recent decision in Counterman when it issued its opinion, the lower courts now do,"" Sotomayor wrote.

This was the second time the Supreme Court has gotten involved in Mckesson’s case.

In 2020, the court said the appeals court wrongly decided Mckesson could be sued without a clear understanding of Louisiana law. They sent the case back for further review.

After completing that review in conjunction with the Louisiana Supreme Court, a split three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit said the lawsuit could proceed.

Mckesson rose to prominence as an activist in the BLM movement during protests in Ferguson, Mo., following the August 2014 shooting death of Black teen Michael Brown by a white police officer.

In 2016, the shooting death of Alton Sterling by a white police officer triggered weeks of protests across the U.S.

During protests in Baton Rouge, La., an officer − identified in the court filings as John Doe − was struck in the face by a rock. He suffered injuries to his brain, jaw and teeth.

The officer’s suit against Black Lives Matter was tossed out on the theory that BLM is a social movement and cannot be sued.

He’s seeking damages against Mckesson on the theory that he “knew or should have known … that violence would result.”

","Lawyers for former President Donald Trump in his fraud trial will need to “challenge the government at every opportunity” — including the statute of limitations determined in the case involving payments to two women, former Judge Andrew Napolitano told Newsmax on Monday.

In an interview on ""Wake Up America,"" Napolitano said he’s skeptical of the prosecution’s interpretation of the alleged crime's timeline.

“The government's theory — and the court has adopted the government's theory — is that because this was an act of deception, the deception was continuous, [that] the statute of limitations … didn't start to run until they were caught,” he explained.

“I don’t abide by that theory myself,” he asserted.

Napolitano noted the statute asserts “you got five years to bring a charge from the time the crime was committed.”

“The court says, Oh no, no, it's a continuous crime because it's an act of deception,” he said.

“So that argument is now history,” he conceded. "" They need to prepare for this trial, and they need to challenge the government at every opportunity.”

Napolitano also pointed out the trial judge, Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan, will have to determine if selected jurors can be fair, noting “nearly everyone has an opinion” about the former president.

“The judge asks the initial 45 or 50 questions to the pool. That's to 250, 300 of potential jurors,” Napolitano said. “If you survive that cut by saying, Yes, I can be fair, then the … lawyers begin asking specific, more precise questions to the jurors in an effort to get in their minds to find out if this person says they can be fair, but can they really be fair?”

“They're not allowed to ask what your religion is; they're not allowed to ask who you voted for; but they can ask just about anything else to get a picture of your brain and form a judgment on your fairness,” he added.

“Donald Trump is the best known human being on the planet … Can you put your opinion of him out of your mind? Can you presume that he is innocent until proven guilty?” Napolitano pointed out. “These are the things that you want to get their answers on.”

"Seven months away from a rematch election pitting President Biden against former President Donald Trump, the incumbent is struggling. Mr. Biden suffers from persistently low approval ratings, he barely manages to tie Mr. Trump in national head-to-head polls and he lags behind the former president in most of the swing states where the election will be decided (despite some recent modestly encouraging movement in his direction).

The question is why.

When Mr. Biden’s defenders seek to answer the question, most of them tick off declining rates of inflation, historically low unemployment, strong economic growth, a list of legislative accomplishments and other evidence of a successful presidency. This suggests the problem is primarily a failure of communication — the thing flailing administrations always blame first, since it implies the path to improvement requires little more than doing a better job of “getting the message out” about how great the president is doing.

It’s usually wiser to listen to what voters are saying — beyond the obvious concerns about the president’s age.

Recently, Gallup released the latest edition of its longstanding survey measuring “satisfaction with the way things are going in the U.S.” Three out of four Americans (75 percent) claimed to be dissatisfied. The long-term trend tells a clear story: From the mid-1990s to late 2004, the level of satisfaction bounced around between 39 percent and 71 percent. But in the aftermath of the George W. Bush administration’s failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and during a yearslong violent insurgency challenging American military occupation of the country, numbers began to slide. They would reach a low of 9 percent satisfaction in October 2008, in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

What followed was a very slow 12-year recovery of satisfaction across almost the entirety of the Obama and Trump administrations, with a post-2004 high of 45 percent reached in February 2020, on the eve of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. By January 2021, the level of satisfaction was back down to 11 percent, just two points off its historical low. Under Joe Biden, Americans briefly became somewhat more upbeat — but figures have sunk again from the mid-30s to the high teens and low 20s in recent months.

These findings mirror what other pollsters have found when they asked respondents about whether they think the country is on the right or wrong track, and about their trust in government and confidence in American institutions. The latter number has been slowly falling since the 1960s, but it, too, really began to collapse in 2004, eventually reaching the low 30s by 2007. In 2023, just 26 percent of Americans expressed confidence in our institutions.

In January 2021, Alana Newhouse published an essay in Tablet, “Everything Is Broken,” that gave voice to this incredibly widespread (but underreported) sentiment. Why did so many people in the United States believe that, as Ms. Newhouse put it in a follow-up essay, “whole parts of American society were breaking down before our eyes”?

The examples are almost too numerous to list: a disastrous war in Iraq; a ruinous financial crisis followed by a decade of anemic growth when most of the new wealth went to those who were already well off; a shambolic response to the deadliest pandemic in a century; a humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan; rising prices and interest rates; skyrocketing levels of public and private debt; surging rates of homelessness and the spread of tent encampments in American cities; undocumented migrants streaming over the southern border; spiking rates of gun violence, mental illness, depression, addiction, suicide, chronic illness and obesity, coupled with a decline in life expectancy.

That’s an awful lot of failure over the past 20-odd years. Yet for the most part, the people who run our institutions have done very little to acknowledge or take responsibility for any of it, let alone undertake reforms that aim to fix what’s broken. That’s no doubt why angry anti-establishment populism has become so prominent in our politics over the past decade — with Mr. Trump, a political outsider, taking over the Republican Party in 2016 by running against the elites of both parties, and Senator Bernie Sanders giving the establishment favorite Hillary Clinton a run for her money that same year by taking on the banking and finance sectors of the economy, along with their Democratic and Republican enablers.

Mr. Biden has never been that kind of politician. Most of the time he speaks and acts as if he thinks American institutions are doing perfectly fine — at least so long as Mr. Trump doesn’t get his hands on them. Part of that is undoubtedly because Mr. Biden is an incumbent, and incumbents always find themselves having to defend what they’ve done in office, which isn’t compatible with acting like an insurgent going to war against the system.

Then there’s the fact that Mr. Biden has worked within our elected institutions since the Nixon administration, making him deeply invested in them (and implicated in their failures). Finally, as a Democrat who came of age during the heyday of mid-20th-century liberalism, Mr. Biden is wedded to the idea of using a functional, competent and capable federal government to improve people’s lives — whether or not more recent history validates that faith.

This places him badly out of step with the national mood, speaking a language very far removed from the talk of a broken country that suffuses Mr. Trump’s meandering and often unhinged remarks on the subject. The more earnest statements of the third-party candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West and Jill Stein also speak to aspects of our brokenness, taking ample and often nostalgic note of what’s gone wrong and promising bold, if vague, action to begin an effort of repair.

That leaves Mr. Biden as the lone institutionalist defender of the status quo surrounded by a small army of brokenists looking for support from an electorate primed to respond to their more downcast message.

There may be limits to what Mr. Biden can do to respond. For one thing, his 81-year-old frailty can’t help appearing to mirror the fragile state of our public institutions. For another, in an era of political bad feeling, when presidential approval ratings sink quickly and never recover, incumbents from both parties may no longer enjoy the kind of advantage in seeking re-election that they once did, at least at the national level.

Still, there are things the Biden campaign could do to help the president better connect with voters.

First, he should stop being so upbeat — about the economy in particular — and making the election entirely about the singular awfulness of his opponent. While the latter sounds evasive, the former makes the president seem hopelessly out of touch and risks antagonizing people who aren’t in the mood for a chipper message.

Mr. Biden should instead try to meet Americans where they are. He should admit Washington has gotten a lot of things wrong over the past two decades and sound unhappy about and humbled by it. He could make the argument that all governments make mistakes because they are run by fallible human beings — but also point out that elected representatives in a democracy should be upfront about error and resolve to learn from mistakes so that they avoid them in the future. Just acknowledging how much in America is broken could generate a lot of good will from otherwise skeptical and dismissive voters.

Even better would be an effort to develop a reform agenda: Mr. Biden could declare it’s long past time for America to put its house in order, to begin cleaning up the messes of the past two decades, to face our problems and return to our own best national self. He might even think of adapting and repurposing for the center-left a few lines from Ronald Reagan’s first Inaugural Address: “It’s not my intention to do away with government. It is rather to make it work — work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it.”

In concrete terms, this means pledging to reform existing institutions and programs, not promising to build new ones on top of the ambitious legislation and substantial spending Congress passed during Mr. Biden’s first two years in office. It means, instead, a commitment to pause and begin assessing what government has been doing at all levels, under both Republican and Democratic leadership, over the past two decades.

It means, more specifically, a resolution to continue and expand existing reviews into what worked and what didn’t during the pandemic — in red states and blue states, in cities, suburbs and small towns — in order to prepare for a better response the next time we confront a public-health emergency. It means talking honestly about the surging and unsustainable national debt and what it will take to begin reining it in. It means trying to help government function better, including a concerted effort to increase state capacity, eliminate regulations that constrain the nation’s housing supply and build on the administration’s attempts at permitting reform to streamline or remove regulations that slow down and increase the cost of private as well as public development.

These projects will far outlast a second Biden term. But the president can promise to get them started, with the remaining work to be completed by presidents and generations to come.

Taking this approach may help to neutralize the populist advantages Mr. Trump enjoys (at least when he isn’t running as an incumbent). However much voters appreciate his denunciations of a corrupt and rigged system, as well as his management of the economy over the first three years of his presidency, they have no love for the G.O.P.’s obsession with pairing cuts to entitlement programs and upper-income tax rates with draconian restrictions on abortion — not to mention Mr. Trump’s focus on personal grievances and legal recklessness. That leaves plenty of room for Mr. Biden to make a case for himself as the guy who can enact the sweeping reforms American needs, and without all the unnecessary and dangerous drama a second Trump administration would surely bring.

Everything is broken — or so it feels to many of our fellow citizens. Denying this reality only empowers populist candidates whose message acquires its potency by pointing to an entrenched political establishment unwilling or unable to learn from (or even admit) its myriad mistakes. That shirking needs to stop. And it should do so with Joe Biden.","n response to Iran's ""unprecedented historic"" attack on Israel, former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe sounded the alarm on the ""long list"" of deterrence failures committed by the Biden administration.

During his appearance on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Ratcliffe argued that the Biden administration’s ""fractured"" relationship with Israel emboldened Iran to strike Israel, an assertion that has been echoed by many Americans.

Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe argued that the Biden administration has taken the ‘wrong response’ to the aftermath of Iran's unprecedented attacks on Israel.  (Fox News)

JOHN RATCLIFFE: The word people keep using to describe this attack is unprecedented, and it is. But that's why it's ironic that we find ourselves in the all too familiar position of talking about a long list of deterrence failures by the Biden administration. Of course, the failure to deter Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine and then, after the attack on Israel on October the 7th, the failure of the Biden administration with hollow talking points, A single word 'Don't.' And the response to that, as you know, was more than 170 attacks on U.S. Forces. And the deaths of three Americans, dozens of traumatic brain injuries, so clearly not working. Which is why I was surprised that those very same hollow words and threats from the Biden administration, 'Don't,' were used last week, after Israel took out IRGC general. Mohammad Zahedi, who was the architect of those October 7th attacks. 

BIDEN CALLING FOR G7 MEETING IN RESPONSE TO IRAN'S 'BRAZEN' ATTACK

And again, it didn't work. An unprecedented attack, 300 drones, missiles, rockets – including cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. So, you mentioned the fact that there's been credit given for the good work of the Israelis and the Brits and the Jordanians and the United States in reacting to this and shooting down most of those threats, and minimizing the damage. But, reaction isn't as good as prevention. And Donald Trump is right when he said he would have prevented this and the Israelis believed that this would have been prevented.

They were understandably surprised and upset, as was I, that the seeds for this failure in deterrence took place in Joe Biden's reaction to that hit in Damascus, on Zahedi, where instead of just remaining silent, the Biden administration quickly came out and said the U.S. was not involved in this. And that sent a message to Iran and to the rest of the world that the U.S. was not with Israel, that the U.S. was reluctant to support Israel on this and that really shows how fractured this relationship has become between the United States and Israel moving forward. And I think that emboldened Iran. And as one of the former intelligence officials in Iran said to me last night, with friends like Joe Biden, Israel doesn't need more enemies. ","In the more than 370 days between his first indictment and his first criminal trial, Donald Trump unleashed rhetorical warfare as predictable as it was extreme.

The familiar slash and burn playbook, sharpened over decades in business and eight years in politics, has shaped an overlapping public defense and political message at an unprecedented moment of legal peril.

But the volume and repetition – always repetition, longtime allies note – obscures a stark reality.

For a former president who has unapologetically shattered norms with an unrelenting message of grievance, vengeance and retribution targeting those who stand in the way of his policy and political ambitions, the rhetoric is far from empty.

Trump emerged from the Republican primary – where he bulldozed his opponents – supported by a policy and personnel infrastructure designed to turn his rhetoric into reality.

His pledge to direct Justice Department investigations is backed by allies who view his second term as driven by a maximalist theory of a president’s authority.

Threats to target political enemies across the government are underpinned by planned executive action.

The system and guardrails Trump spent his first term perpetually straining and thrashing against on Capitol Hill, in the courts and within his own White House, have tilted in his favor.

“Democrats hit first, so we’re going to hit back harder,” a Republican official in regular communication with Trump’s inner circle told CNN in reference to the former president’s four criminal indictments, which include charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith for attempting to overturn the 2020 election and unlawfully retaining classified documents.

There is no proof that the special counsel’s indictments were tied to political motivations, and the allegation, made repeatedly by Trump, that Biden’s White House directed the investigations is a lie.

Confronted with those facts, the official responded without hesitation.

“That’s what he believes. That’s what his people believe,” the official said. “And unlike last time, this is his party now.”

The concept of a former president set to be the Republican Party’s nominee for a third consecutive election just now claiming the party is, on its face, nonsensical.
Yet it’s a critical element to why this moment for Trump and his supporters is so different than any prior.

If Trump manages to dodge or delay his legal troubles and win the presidential election in November, he and allies will enter to White House more personally emboldened, politically powerful and with a more expansive view of a president’s authority than any administration in recent memory.

That is an opportunity Trump and his allies have moved aggressively to ensure isn’t wasted.

“We are going to finish what we started,” Trump pledged during a March 2023 rally. “We will totally obliterate the deep state.”

2024 rhetoric
Trump has framed the 2024 campaign as existing to save the nation from an apocalyptic implosion.

The rematch with Biden is the “final battle.” Trump is but a vessel for his supporters, he says. He’s their “retribution. He’s their “warrior.” He’s their “justice.”

The debate over Trump’s words has hung over US politics since his 2015 announcement. Should he be taken seriously or literally? Does he mean what he says or is he throwing red meat to his base? Is it getting darker? More autocratic? More extreme?

In the last year, Trump has threatened to appoint a special prosecutor to target President Joe Biden and his family if he’s reelected.

He’s repeatedly attacked prosecutors and judges, their families and relationships, former officials and political opponents.

He called for former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney and the other members of the House panel that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol to be jailed.

He floated the execution of the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

And amid all these statements, Trump currently sits ahead of, or within the margin of error, Biden in national and key swing state polling. His rock-solid base of die-hard supporters certainly hasn’t diminished.

On some level, either many voters don’t seem to mind or, in the view of many Republican and Democratic strategists alike, have grown so accustomed to the extreme nature of his rhetoric that it has just been tuned out.

“The guy accused the sitting president of being on cocaine last week and nobody even blinked,” one senior Democratic campaign official said when asked about the effect. (That did actually happen, though it wasn’t a new Trump tactic – he floated Biden being on drugs in 2020, too.)

When Trump talks about vengeance and retribution, there are plenty of examples that can be viewed through a similar lens.

After all, his 2016 campaign was animated by the explicit call to jail his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.

But while Trump’s Justice Department never pursued charges against Clinton, multiple former officials confirmed that Trump raised the idea of prosecuting Clinton while in the White House. The list of opponents – and former allies who became opponents – who Trump would raise to staff for potential prosecution was long, the officials said.

“One of my favorite preoccupations as national security adviser was counting how many times Donald Trump said that John Kerry should be prosecuted,” former Trump official John Bolton said of the former Democratic senator and secretary of state.

Bolton has said repeatedly he will not support Trump and views him as a danger to the country, as have more than a dozen of Trump’s former Cabinet officials and senior White House aides.

It’s a striking reality with no precedent.

But it also underscores why a second Trump term would be dramatically different.

Critics gone
Trump repeatedly ran headlong into advisers, lawmakers and judges loath to bend to his will in his first term.

His allies viewed these as unnecessary – or in some cases, unlawful – impediments to the agenda voters sent to the Oval Office in 2016.

Some in Washington saw them as guardrails for a White House intent on fracturing not one, but all three branches of government.

Yet Trump, should he secure a second term, would enter the White House with his most powerful Republican critics on Capitol Hill almost all gone.

If House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sought to quietly placate and pacify Trump in his first two years in office, Congressional Republicans nowadays more often seek to elevate and advance his wishes.

Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, retired and has called Trump a “populist, authoritarian narcissist.” McConnell, who has not spoken to Trump since the end of 2020 after condemning his actions during the January 6 attack on the Capitol, will depart his position as Senate GOP leader at the end of this Congress. He has endorsed Trump.
House Speaker Mike Johnson, the Louisiana Republican who holds Ryan’s old job, traveled to Mar-a-Lago on Friday to hold a joint press event with Trump as he seeks to beat back efforts to remove him from the position.

Trump isn’t one for detailing regrets, but one of the few he’s acknowledged is the people he surrounded himself with when he entered the White House in 2017.

“I made a mistake with some people I put in,” Trump said during an interview last month with NEWSMAX. “I now know people. I now know, I believe, Washington probably at the upper levels, better than anybody.”

There’s a roster of Cabinet officials and senior White House advisers who saw their role as minimizing or ignoring what they viewed as Trump’s worst instincts and ideas. Many candidly acknowledged that reality after their departures.

Trump is now surrounded in and around his campaign by advisers who aren’t just loyalists who espouse his “America First” approach, but also hardened by their own lessons learned from the first administration.

His campaign has released an expansive and far-reaching series of policy outlines that the former president regularly highlights in the scripted sections of his campaign rallies.

A constellation of outside groups filled with former top Trump administration officials and loyalists have dedicated millions of dollars and an expansive network to build out the policy and personnel resources that will almost certainly be drawn upon should Trump win a second term.

That infrastructure, while not in total alignment and at times in the position of getting crosswise with one another, puts Trump’s words in a dramatically different context.
There is clear alignment on the embrace of a maximalist view of presidential authority that Trump could use to dispense with the long-standing concept of Justice Department independence.

That includes an explicit pledge, detailed in his campaign policy plans, to direct Justice Department civil rights investigations against district attorneys in Democratic cities.

Two of Trump’s indictments were filed by Democratic district attorneys.
Trump’s pledge to fire career government officials deemed insufficiently loyal is backed by an effort to build on, and utilize, an executive order drafted in the final months of his time in office.

National security and intelligence agencies, long the center of Trump’s most deeply held frustration and grievance for his view of their role in undercutting his authority and leaking damaging information, would be audited, overhauled and subject to widespread terminations.

Seeking retribution
Trump and his campaign have publicly tried to massage his official position on personal retribution.

Trump has repeatedly suggested his indictments mean he has the right to target his political opponents – “pandora’s box,” Trump has said several times.

But when asked directly about his plans for personal revenge, Trump has attempted several ways to deny what those around him say he’s intent on pursuing in a second term.

“No, I wouldn’t do that because I want to bring our country forward,” Trump said when asked last February on “The Hugh Hewitt Show” about punishing those who attacked him, a message his advisors have said he should stick to on the issue. “No, I wouldn’t do that.”

“I would be entitled to a revenge tour if you want to know the truth, but I wouldn’t do that,” he added.

That would be a position that isn’t backed by his second term policy plans, or his private impulses during his first term in office – or, for that matter, in the decades prior.

Trump’s affinity for retribution existed long before his first campaign.
He spoke at length, in a 1992 interview with Charlie Rose, about his desire to get even with those he viewed as disloyal when his business career sat on the verge of collapse.

“If given the opportunity, I will get even with some people who were disloyal to me,” Trump told Rose.

Trump called revenge “very therapeutic” in an interview on CNN’s “Larry King Live” in 2007.

“If you have a problem with someone, you have to go after them,” Trump said in a CNBC interview with Erin Burnett that same year.

The topic was relevant in 2007 for one reason: Trump’s newly released book spent an entire chapter detailing his view on the merits of retribution.

The chapter title: Revenge.","Voters are not shy about saying how bad they perceive things are.

Ask if the nation is heading in the right direction, and barely a quarter of voters will say yes. Ask them whether the national economy is good, and more than 65 percent will say no.

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.
Yet beneath those dire ratings, voters are much more upbeat about how things are where they live. A majority view their state’s economy as doing well, and many are likely to view the state — but not necessarily the nation — as being on the right track.

It’s a strange predicament that has puzzled some economists and has politicians in both parties searching for explanations. That chasm between the state of the states and the state of the nation could determine whether President Biden wins a second term and who will control Congress next year. All this could translate very differently when it comes to how voters size up candidates to represent them on the state, local and national level.

“I have a hard time explaining it, as the fundamentals of our economy are really good,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a close Biden ally, before rattling off recent national economic trends that are almost universally positive. “We’re still believing that something’s wrong with the country and things are bad and things are headed in a bad direction.”

“They’re saying our economy is good but the national economy stinks,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said Thursday.

A recent, concrete example of this phenomenon came in a poll by the Wall Street Journal, released in early April, of seven key presidential battlegrounds: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

The head-to-head results drew much of the attention, with Trump narrowly leading in five states and essentially tied in two others. And a good deal of attention went to how, in aggregate, just 25 percent of voters in those states thought the nation was headed in the right direction and only 36 percent considered the nation’s economy “excellent” or “good.”

Tillis saw the poll and was surprised by how “really soft” North Carolina’s numbers were, with just 33 percent saying the economy was good.

He missed the question about how North Carolinians view their own economy: Sixty-four percent rated it as excellent or good. Basically, almost a third of his state’s voters think the national economy remains bleak but the Tar Heel State is doing quite well.

The same dynamic unfolds in all seven swing states. On average, 54 percent of voters said their state’s economy was excellent or good while 43 percent said it was not good, but their views of the national economy were reversed: 36 percent saying it was at least good, 63 percent disapproving of the nation’s economy.


Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), facing one of the tougher reelection battles this fall, said it makes sense that more than 50 percent of Nevadans believe their economy is solid, yet she struggles to understand the disconnect on why barely a third find the national economy to be strong.

“We see the billions of dollars from the infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act that have come to Nevada, $500 million to a program we call Home Means Nevada for affordable housing. We have the first high-speed rail going in west of the Mississippi from Las Vegas to Los Angeles,” Rosen said.

Tillis is also bullish on North Carolina’s economy, with its 3.5 percent unemployment rate below the national average.

“Our economy is booming,” he said, citing recent private-sector investments in North Carolina worth $4 billion from a pharmaceutical manufacturer, $5 billion from a semiconductor company and $4 billion for electric-vehicle battery production.

He acknowledged that, despite continued concerns about inflation, most of the national economy is on sound footing.

“The reality is our economy is doing pretty well. Most of those other states are doing pretty good, most of them not as well as North Carolina,” Tillis said.

But according to the second-term senator, any question about the nation’s standing — whether about the economy or just about any issue — turns into a simple referendum on a president’s popularity.

“I could see why they’d feel like, ‘I’m good, but I don’t like where we’re headed nationally.’ I think that’s a proxy vote or job-approval vote,” Tillis said.

Coons suggested that part of the problem comes through media echo chambers still carrying out the battles over the past few years, particularly in conservative outlets where the economy is often talked down.

“Hangover from the pandemic and high inflation, and other political figures who are saying we’re in a recession when we are not,” he said.

Some Democrats don’t consider this to be a problem, but rather an opportunity, because many swing-state voters are seeing improvement in their daily lives. They predict that approval for the national outlook is a lagging indicator that Democrats have time to show progress before the November elections.

“You don’t spring out of the trauma that this country went through, and then the world went through, with a global economic shutdown, with a pandemic, with high inflation,” Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.) said Thursday. “You don’t spring out of that and say, ‘Now I feel fine because I can take my mask off.’”

Dean said her state’s slow and steady improvement in the eyes of its voters should buck up Democratic spirits.


In May 2022, as inflation remained at 40-year highs, just 25 percent of Pennsylvanians said the state was headed in the right direction, according to the Franklin & Marshall College poll, which regularly tracks the state’s trajectory. Almost 65 percent viewed things to be going in the wrong direction.

But those numbers have steadily improved, with fewer than 50 percent of Pennsylvanians now saying the state is headed in the wrong direction. But according to the Journal poll, almost 70 percent Pennsylvanians still believe the nation is headed in the wrong direction.

The Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, remains very popular now: Fifty-four percent approve of his performance, according to Franklin & Marshall. That’s almost 20 points higher than Biden’s approval in Pennsylvania, although this poll did have the incumbent president ahead of the ex-president in the head-to-head matchup.

Shapiro is not the only popular swing-state governor.

In Georgia, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has an approval rating that almost exactly matches how voters feel about the state’s economy (59 percent rating it as good, 38 percent bad, according to the Journal poll). In North Carolina, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s popularity easily outpaces the state’s senators’ ratings as well as those of the nominees to succeed him in office.

In Wisconsin, where the GOP-dominated legislature has clashed with him for years, Gov. Tony Evers (D) is also much more popular than any other figure in the state.

According to the Journal poll, 57 percent of Wisconsin voters consider their economy excellent or good, while just 40 percent do not like it.

Still, when asked about the national economy, Wisconsin voters flip those numbers around. And when they get asked about the overall direction of the nation, just 31 percent say it’s on the right track.

Tillis believes that national malaise comes through in a collection of issues that almost all are bad for Biden, including the border crisis, crime and crises overseas.

“I think it’s immigration. I think it’s economy. I think it’s international leadership,” he said. “There’s no other way to explain it.”

Some of this is a new normal, resembling a prior generation’s axiom that voters hated Congress but loved their own congressman.

In Virginia, for example, 53 percent of voters approve of the job performance by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, according to a Roanoke College poll last month, and 49 percent approve of the job by the Democratic-controlled legislature in Richmond.

Just 37 percent of Virginians approved of Biden’s performance, with a lowly 16 percent approving of Congress.

Dean noted that inflation, which remained at a nettlesome 3.5 percent last month, still worries voters. But she remains optimistic that the overall economy will continue to grow.

Those things, combined with liberal energy driven by abortion bans taking root in many states, give Democrats a good chance, she said.

“People are feeling these things, in areas after areas after areas,” Dean said of local economies. “There’s plenty of time. Layer into that women’s choice, women’s reproductive health — there’s plenty of time for a very big Biden win.”","Facing the press alongside the House speaker, fellow Republican Mike Johnson, Donald Trump bragged: “We broke Roe v Wade.”

The former president made the stark admission about his dominant role in attacks on abortion rights at the end of a week in which the rightwing Arizona state supreme court ruled that an 1864 law imposing a near-total ban could go back into effect.

Abortion rights were removed at the federal level in 2022 when a US supreme court to which Trump appointed three justices overturned Roe, which had stood since 1973. The issue has fueled Democratic wins at the ballot box ever since. This week, the Arizona ruling sent Republicans scrambling to minimise damage.

Trump repeated his contention that the issue should rest with the states and there is no need for a national ban, a demand of the US’s political right. But he could not resist a boast on which his opponents are sure to seize.

“We broke Roe v Wade,” Trump said. “Nobody thought was possible. We gave it back to the states and the states are working very brilliantly, in some cases conservative, in some cases not conservative, but they’re working. And it’s working the way it’s supposed to.

“Every … real legal scholar wanted to have it go back to the states,” Trump claimed without offering evidence. “Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative. And we were able to do that … and now the states are working their way through it.

“And you’re gonna, you’re having some very, very beautiful harmony, to be honest with you. You have, well, you have some cases like Arizona that went back to like 1864 or something like that. And a judge made a ruling, but that’s going to be changed by government. They’re going to be changing that. I disagree with that.”

At the time of Trump’s remarks, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, was speaking in Arizona, hammering home Democratic attacks on Republican threats to reproductive rights. Her key message: Trump is to blame.

“And just minutes ago, standing beside Speaker Johnson, Donald Trump just said the collection of state bans is, quote: ‘working the way it is supposed to’,” Harris said. “And as much harm as he has already caused, a second Trump term would be even worse.”

Trump and Johnson appeared together at a time of intense legal jeopardy for the former president and great political danger for the House speaker that meant their intended message – a supposed need to focus on the canard of “election integrity” – seemed guaranteed to be drowned out.

In New York on Monday, Trump will face trial on 34 of 88 pending criminal charges. The first ever criminal trial involving a former president will concern hush-money payments to an adult film star who claimed an affair.

In Washington, Johnson must manage Congress with a tiny majority under pressure from an unruly Republican House caucus dominated by the pro-Trump right. The Georgia extremist Marjorie Taylor Greene has filed a motion to remove him.

Opening the press conference at his Mar-a-Lago home, Trump exhibited his signature rhetoric on immigration, increasingly dehumanizing and vicious.

Johnson said Republicans would seek to introduce legislation to “require proof of citizenship to vote”, claiming that if “hundreds of thousands” of migrants cast votes, it could affect the result of the elections.

In reality, non-citizens voting is not even close to a problem.

Some cities allow non-citizens to vote in municipal and non-federal polls. But non-citizen voting in federal elections is already illegal under a 1996 law. Offenders can be fined and jailed for up to a year. Deportation is possible.

The Bipartisan Policy Center points to research by groups on the right and left which says non-citizen voting is exceptionally rare, saying: “Any instance of illegally cast ballots by non-citizens has been investigated by the appropriate authorities, and there is no evidence that these votes – or any other instances of voter fraud – have been significant enough to impact any election’s outcome.”

Nonetheless, Johnson has long shown willingness to back Trump’s claims about elections regardless of reality, playing a key role in supporting the former president’s attempts to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden in 2020.

In a recent memoir, the anti-Trump Republican Liz Cheney said Johnson “played bait-and-switch” with colleagues to get them to support his legal efforts to have key state results thrown out while misrepresenting himself as a constitutional lawyer.

Johnson said Cheney was “not presenting an accurate portrayal”. His legal work failed but even after the deadly January 6 attack on Congress by Trump supporters in early 2021, he was among 147 Republicans who voted to object to results in Pennsylvania and Arizona.

On Friday, a statement released by the Trump campaign said Johnson had “agreed to hold a series of public committee hearings over the next two months … in advance of potential legislation to further safeguard our elections from interference”.

Subjects of supposed concern included “mail-in voting processes and mail-ballot handling”, “voter registration list maintenance and how states will … prevent illegal immigrants and noncitizens from voting in the 2024 presidential election”; and “general preparations” for Trump’s rematch with Biden.

Reporters raised other issues that have roiled Republican politics. Earlier, in Washington, Johnson oversaw passage of a bill to reauthorise the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or Fisa, including a key measure that allows for warrantless surveillance of American citizens. Trump and allies opposed the renewal, arising from his complaints about investigations of Russian election interference on his behalf in the 2016 race that sent him to the White House.

Asked about the House bill, Trump said he still didn’t like Fisa and repeated his complaints about 2016. Johnson nodded behind him.

Trump also opposes new aid for Ukraine, passed by the Senate but held up in the House. Johnson has said he wants to pass aid for Ukraine – but that could cause his downfall.

At Mar-a-Lago, Trump kept the subject at arm’s length, verbally abusing Biden and claiming conflicts around the world would not have happened on his watch.

He also castigated those prosecuting him criminally, including in the hush-money trial due to start in New York on Monday, over which he also complained about the judge. He was, he said, “absolutely” willing to testify in his own defence.","As House members returned to Washington this week, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was already struggling to rally his caucus around a bill to extend a 9/11-era surveillance program. The effort to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act’s Section 702 had already split the House GOP for months. but a compromise of sorts was finally about to hit the floor Wednesday, just days before the program is set to expire. 

And then former President Donald Trump weighed in.

“KILL FISA, IT WAS ILLEGALLY USED AGAINST ME AND MANY OTHERS. THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN!!!” he wrote on Truth Social, resurrecting one of his long-standing false claims about the 2016 election. And the bill being debated didn’t concern all of FISA, just Section 702. But Trump’s post was enough to bolster a revolt among conservative Republicans, 19 of whom voted with Democrats to block the reauthorization bill from coming up for debate. For once, though, the GOP’s disarray and obedience to Trump fortuitously may be put to good use. While Trump’s “Spygate” narrative remains false, it may be harnessed to improve a broken part of America’s intelligence-gathering system.

For once, though, the GOP’s disarray and obedience to Trump fortuitously may be put to good use.

Section 702 was first tacked on to FISA in 2008 to legalize a once-secret program intelligence agencies use to stockpile communications data from foreigners living abroad without warrants. It quickly became clear that key safeguards, which were meant to protect Americans’ data caught up in the sweep from being reviewed without warrants, were failing. A court order released last year from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which oversees the use of FISA’s spying tools, showed that the FBI had repeatedly violated its own standards for searching Section 702 data for information about Americans.

We should be careful not give Trump too much credit, though. Again, his claims about FISA’s being used to illegally spy on his campaign are false. And the former president has forgotten he already flip-flopped on this issue. Trump’s post Wednesday also echoes a tweet from him in 2018, when Section 702 was last up for reauthorization. He wound up reversing course when members of his Cabinet and then-Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., rushed to make sure that he supported the bill that his administration had publicly backed.

Moreover, the early stages of the Russia investigation — what Trump misleadingly characterizes as “spying” — didn’t depend on the Section 702 collection system. Instead, the FBI’s counterintelligence team went to the FISC for a warrant to surveil Carter Page, a campaign aide, to see whether he was communicating with Russian assets. That has been spun into the full “Spygate” narrative that Trump has been peddling since 2017 as a way to undercut the investigation entirely. While the Justice Department’s inspector general did find faults in the approval for the FISA warrant against Page, the IG also concluded that the investigation was properly opened. Trump-appointed special counsel John Durham was also unable to find any evidence of wrongdoing in the FBI’s opening its investigation.

Despite all that, this is a case in which Trump’s delusions are potentially being harnessed for a net positive result. Section 702 itself feels like a necessary evil as far as preventing terror attacks and other clear national security threats originating abroad, but the ability to turn that system’s powers back on Americans, in violation of the Fourth Amendment, is one that demands the strictest of firewalls. Civil liberties groups have called for allowing it to sunset entirely absent major reforms, letting the intelligence community focus on other methods of collection, instead.

Despite all that, this is a case in which Trump’s delusions are potentially being harnessed for a net positive result.

While Trump’s post rallied conservative opponents to the bill, it’s striking that the rule that was voted down Wednesday managed to get out of committee only because of a proposed bipartisan amendment to the reauthorization bill. The list of co-sponsors is one that you’d never expect to see grouped together, ranging from committed progressives to MAGA die-hards: Reps. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.; Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.; Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.; Warren Davidson, R-Ohio; Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.; and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Their proposed change would block “warrantless searches of U.S. person communications in the FISA 702 database, with exceptions for imminent threats to life or bodily harm, consent searches, or known cybersecurity threat signatures.”

GUN SAFETY
Republicans can’t stand the idea of Biden closing the ‘gun show loophole’
Frank Figliuzzi
The Biden administration and the intelligence community have come out against the amendment, as it would “rebuild a wall around and thus block access to already lawfully collected information in the possession of the U.S. government,” as national security adviser Jake Sullivan put it. But just because the information was lawfully collected doesn’t mean that the government should be able to rifle through it with minimal legal protections. (And even if the authorizing legislation lapses, an extension from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court means that the program will continue for another year.)

With that in mind, Johnson has a few options for what to do next. The procedural vote failed only under united opposition from congressional Democrats, given that the rule also would have brought a pair of resolutions denouncing President Joe Biden’s policies to the floor, as well. It’s possible that Johnson could ditch those poison pills and revive the bill and its accompanying amendment before the April 19 deadline to keep the provision from expiring entirely. Or he could push for another short-term extension, like one passed in December, to keep it afloat for another few months.

But it’s clear that Section 702 isn’t likely to be extended in full without at least some major changes. Trump’s delusions about the “deep state” are usually best treated as the ramblings of someone upset that his authoritarian instincts are being trampled. For once, though, his ranting might legitimately help safeguard Americans’ rights.","Two more Democratic presidential nominating contents were held on Saturday, in Alaska and Wyoming.

President Joe Biden is projected to win both, ABC News reports.

Both Alaska and Wyoming's state parties held caucuses, though Biden, who is set to face former President Donald Trump in November's general election, was the only major candidate running and clinched his party's nomination earlier this year.

Twenty-eight delegates were up for grabs for the Democratic winner of both states.","Washington — In the aftermath of the unprecedented airstrikes by Iran against Israel, President Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. will not participate in a reprisal strike on Iran, according to a senior administration official. 

Israel reported only minor damage to a military base after more than 300 missiles and drones were fired from Iran toward Israel Saturday night, most of which were intercepted before entering Israeli territory. 

IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said at a late Sunday briefing that Israel intercepted 99% of the approximately 350 ""suicide drones, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and rockets"" launched from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Five ballistic missiles got through Israeli and U.S. air defenses and struck Israeli territory, two U.S. officials told CBS News. Four of them landed at what U.S officials said was Iran's primary target — Nevatim Airbase, where Israeli F-35s are based. One missile hit a runway, another hit an empty hanger and another hit a hangar that was no longer in use. A fifth missile that appeared to be aimed at a radar site in northern Israel missed its target, the officials said.

The Iranian attack was designed to saturate Israeli and U.S. air defenses with drones and cruise missiles, clearing the way for the ballistic missiles, the officials said. U.S. aircraft operating out of bases in Jordan and Saudi Arabia were waiting for the drones and shot down between 70-80 of them, with some aircraft shooting down more than one drone.

The American part of the operation was commanded by CENTCOM commander Gen. Erik Kurilla, who was patched into the White House Situation Room from his command post in Jordan.

The retaliatory attack marked the Islamic republic's first-ever direct offensive against Israel and came less than two weeks after an airstrike widely attributed to Israel destroyed Iran's consulate in Syria's capital and killed 13 people, including two high-ranking Iranian generals. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said the ""cowardly crime will not go unanswered,"" according to Agence France-Presse.

Israel has repeatedly targeted military officials from Iran, which supports militant groups fighting Israel in Gaza, and along its border with Lebanon. The strike in Damascus marked an escalation because it struck an Iranian diplomatic mission.

Mr. Biden, who spoke with Netanyahu on Saturday, condemned the Iranian assault while making clear that the U.S. had ""helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles,"" according to a White House House statement. Mr. Biden said he reaffirmed to Netanyahu the U.S.'s ""ironclad commitment"" to Israel's security.

Mr. Biden said he reaffirmed to Netanyahu the U.S.'s ""ironclad commitment"" to Israel's security.

National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said the president's call with Netanyahu was a ""good conversation"" that focused on Israel's successful defense against the airstrikes. Kirby said the president made clear during the conversation that the U.S. is working to avoid a broader regional conflict.

""The Prime Minister is well aware that the president is not looking for a conflict with Iran, that the president doesn't want the tensions to escalate anymore, and that the president is doing everything — and has since the seventh of October — to try to keep this from becoming a broader regional war,"" Kirby told Margaret Brennan on ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, adding that the U.S. will take ""whatever steps we need to take"" to protect American troops, ships and facilities in the region.

Mr. Biden also spoke Sunday with King Abdullah of Jordan, noting that Iran's attack ""also threatened Jordan and the Jordanian people,"" according to a White House readout of the call.

The president convened with G7 leaders on Sunday to coordinate a diplomatic response to the attack. In a joint statement after the meeting, the leaders said that Iran has ""further stepped toward the destabilization of the region and risks provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation,"" adding that they would continue to work to ""stabilize the situation."" The leaders demanded that Iran stop its attacks, noting that they stand ready to ""take further measures"" in response to additional actions. The United Nations Security Council is also set to hold an emergency meeting Sunday afternoon.

Former U.S. Central Command Commander Gen. Frank McKenzie, who also appeared on ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, advised Israel to exercise restraint after the Iranian attack. 

""The fact of the matter is Israel can name the price they want to exact, the wide gap between Iranian zealotry and enthusiasm and Israeli competence has now been laid bare for all to see,"" McKenzie said. ""So the Israelis will be able to do what they want. Sometimes when you're in that position, showing some restraint is the best strategic option that you can take.""

McKenzie said Israel is ""stronger this morning than they were yesterday,"" having successfully intercepted the bulk of an unprecedented airstrike from Iran in a ""major combat test.""

""I think this was a big attack by Iran. I think this was as close to a maximum effort as they could generate,"" he said. ""Iran could not replicate last night's attack tonight, if they had to.""

The developments came more than six months into Israel's war with Hamas, as Mr. Biden has been under intense pressure from his party to be more firm with Israel's government due to a staggering civilian death toll in Gaza following the Oct. 7 attacks. According to a CBS News/YouGov poll released on Sunday that was conducted before Iran's drone and missile attack on Israel, an increasing number of Americans want the president to encourage Israel to stop military actions in Gaza.

""Even while under attack from Iran, we have not lost sight—not for one moment—of our critical mission in Gaza to rescue our hostages from the hands of Iran's-proxy Hamas, of our moral duty to do everything in our power to bring 133 hostages home."" Hagari said at Sunday's briefing. ","Former President Donald Trump has continued to attack players in his criminal hush money case that began Monday morning, most recently with an attack on potential key witness Michael Cohen on Saturday, despite a gag order issued by Judge Juan Merchan.

""Has disgraced attorney and felon Michael Cohen been prosecuted for LYING?"" Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday.

Trump's tendency to attack those involved in his trials
The former president has shown a penchant for launching accusations and insults towards judges, prosecutors, and potential witnesses he deems hostile, but he could face fines or even jail time if Merchan determines it runs afoul of a gag order the judge issued and more recently expanded.

Based on what Merchan described as a history of ""threatening, inflammatory, denigrating"" statements against officials, court staff, and prosecutors, he issued an order in late March barring Trump from publicly commenting about the participation of potential witnesses in the case, such as porn star Stormy Daniels and former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.

Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's longtime personal attorney, testifies before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Feb. 27, 2019, in Washington. He is expected to testify in Donald Trump's hush money case starting April 15, 2024.
Merchan also prohibited public statements about court staff and prosecution lawyers other than Bragg, as well as their family members, if the comments are meant to significantly interfere with their work in the case.

Days after that order was issued, Trump attacked Merchan's daughter in a series of posts on Trump's Truth Social media platform, calling her ""a Rabid Trump Hater"" and posting a photo of her, leading the judge to expand the gag order to prohibit the former president from publicly commenting on Merchan's or Bragg's family members if the comments are meant to significantly interfere with work in the case.

""The average observer, must now, after hearing Defendant's recent attacks, draw the conclusion that if they become involved in these proceedings, even tangentially, they should worry not only for themselves, but for their loved ones as well,"" Merchan wrote in the decision.

Former President Donald Trump arrives at NY Criminal Court Monday morning, April 15, 2024.
“I just was informed that another corrupt New York Judge, Juan Merchan, GAGGED me so that I can not talk about the corruption and conflicts taking place in his courtroom,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social in response.

Trump is also blocked from making any public comments about potential or actual jurors.

Posting clips on daughter despite threat of fines or jail
But he has continued to go after Merchan's daughter by posting clips of others talking about her, such as a segment from Fox News in which host Brian Kilmeade claimed the judge's daughter is a Democratic activist.


During his recent New York civil fraud trial, Trump claimed without evidence that a clerk for Judge Arthur Engoron was in a romantic relationship with a prominent Democratic lawmaker, leading the judge to issue a gag order. During that trial, Engoron said his office had been ""inundated"" with threats from Trump supporters.

In the civil trial Engoron imposed a gag order and Trump was fined $10,000 after the judge determined Trump violated the order by reiterating his public attacks on Engoron's clerk. In total, Engoron fined Trump twice for a total of $15,000, which is only 0.000006% of Trump’s estimated $2.6 billion net worth at the time.","Former attorney Michael Avenatti said Monday that ""the fix is in"" as former President Donald Trump headed to a criminal trial in New York.

Trump faces 34 charges of falsifying business records related to payments made to former adult film star Stormy Daniels, allegedly to cover up an affair just before the 2016 election. The former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Avenatti, who previously represented Daniels and is currently serving a prison sentence for stealing nearly $300,000 from his former client, on Monday criticized the judge presiding over Trump's case for issuing a gag order against Trump and criticized Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for allowing two witnesses to make critical statements about Trump in the media.

""The fix is in. Never before has there been a high-profile criminal case in America where a prosecutor (Bragg) permitted, and likely encouraged, two critical witnesses (Cohen & Daniels) to use the media in the days leading up to trial to trash a gagged defendant (Trump) and violate his right to a fair trial,"" Avenatti wrote on X.

""And to my friends on the left who insist they want to 'preserve Democracy' and 'Justice', you should be equally outraged by this. Constitutional protections either exist for all (including Trump) or they don't exist for any. What is happening in the hush money case is a travesty,"" he added.

Avenatti told MSNBC in an interview last week that he believes Trump will be convicted in the trial despite saying that the prosecution's case ""rests on a legally tenuous theory, namely that the crime that was attempted to be covered up was a federal election crime. I think that could be a problem potentially on appeal for the state.""

Avenatti in 2022 was sentenced to to 14 years in federal prison for stealing millions of dollars from his clients."
